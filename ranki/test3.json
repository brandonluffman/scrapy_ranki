\"title\": \"Great for 100% Apple Users\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"June 12, 2022\", \"content\": \"I got these to replace Sony MDR-1000X's (the first generation of the WH-1000XM line), these have a much nicer build quality and appearance than the black Sony's however I think the Noise Cancelling is pretty much the same which is disappointing as the Sony's are now 5 years old. The positives however are that the connection is much easier to manage, the Sony's used to be a pain to get to sync to multiple devices, the AirPods Max are much better in that regard. I'm sure that's mostly the H1 chip and using Apple devices but it's so much more pleasant not to fight Bluetooth to get them to connect. The AirPods Max are clearly designed to emulate the experience of AirPods, they don't have a powerbutton and are meant to be put back in the case after use, and then when removed from case are already connected to your device. They work well in that sense. Where it doesn't make sense though is that the 'smart' case you get is odd, it's not protective but it's also not small enough to pocket, so you end up buying a third party hard case for travelling and then for taking the headphones to work etc you don't take the smart case. The only positive is that the headphones left outside the case still go into their lower power states, but it's just slower to do so than it is in the case. Still, this is a very strange solution for a problem that would have been solved by just having a physical off button, as it is they drain a small amount of battery even if in the case. It feels like Apple being stubborn about maintaining the characteristics of 'AirPods' despite the over ear headphone category having different expectations. I have had issues with them being left a couple of days in the case and getting 'stuck' off and needing to be plugged in to 'revive' them, bizarre, and again, would have been solved with a physical power button. Overall however I like the sound quality and the fit and finish but think they only make sense for users who are 100% inside Apple's ecosystem.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"\\u00b7 Review provided by digitec.ch\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlpsmgqJn-AhUQE1kFHddaAh0QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Great headphones! Just bear with nitpicky points\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"October 7, 2022\", \"content\": \"All the expectation surrounding the quality of these headphones was pleasantly met. If you are looking for clear and balanced sound, these fit the bill. They feel solid in your hands (and heavy on the head) but comfortable to wear (at least for me) for a few hours. Noise cancellation is better than my Sony XM4. Digital crown dial and secondary button does the trick to play, pause, and toggle ANC (Sony did spoil me with the tapping of headset to play/pause but it's fine) Spatial audio is mind blowing and the convenience to easily connect to any Apple device - including the Apple TV is how you're rewarded for being a part of their ecosystem. Sony's way to pair only two devices simultaneously comes at a cost of lower bitrate of music. And if paired with an iPhone, when people call me, they tell me I sound great with little background noise.\", \"source\": \"SpinalTap \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlpsmgqJn-AhUQE1kFHddaAh0QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"They sound better than you first think\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"April 5, 2022\", \"content\": \"I think it should take a lot to get a real 5-star product review, and most of the time Apple can be close (depending on how much of their stuff you have to integrate with). I have and love the AirPod Pros for day-to-day with calls, music, audiobooks, and recently been using them on planes for work commuting more and more as the noise canceling is pretty good. I got these because they were on sale and my old pair of Sony WH-1000XM3 (which I loved) were failing, so I figured I would buy these and worst case exchange for Sony headphones if these weren't worth the premium. I watched a lot of reviews, MKBHD had a review and I thought it seemed oversold on sound quality compared to what I thought was really good with the Sony options always, and I was initially underwhelmed and worried I would end up exchanging. Then I let them sit for a bit and settled in and used them for a day or two for my calls/video conferencing and music. I started to realize how much clarity I got without really losing anything. Instead of getting that punchy bass everywhere, you get bass that really acts as emphasis. Vocals are crystal clear. Mic quality is excellent. Comfort wise it is great over long periods. Noise canceling is at least as good (honestly seems better) than other headests I've had. Ambient mode is way better and doesn't have that harsh sound. Only knock on it is if you're doing anything active with them on I feel like the mesh cups do tend to absorb a bit more. The plastic backing makes it a little hard to clean but not impossible. They DO sell replacement ones, so I guess in the long run if it gets bad, it's replaceable. I do wonder the same about the headband material if it will get gross or stretched, but these first few weeks it's so comfortable I find reasons to reach for this headset over listening on other devices, just because I am liking it that much!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"sirkensington \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlpsmgqJn-AhUQE1kFHddaAh0QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Pricey remote work headphones that work fantastic for calls\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"March 16, 2023\", \"content\": \"After seeing all the reviews and videos on the Air pods Max I decided to go with these instead of the Sony XM's because of the many reviews I saw of people feeling a lot of pressure on their head with ANC.\", \"source\": \"MICHELLE \\u00b7 Review provided by nfm.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlpsmgqJn-AhUQE1kFHddaAh0QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Amazing audio.

The Airpods Max are very comfortable for long periods of time. The audio quality is great and crystal clear. It has good bass but not great. The noise canceling does a good job at atopping unwanted noises from interrupting your listening experience. All around, it is a beat of a product. You cannot go wrong with it. I own the XM5\\u2019s and comparing the two, the aipods max are more comfortable but the Sony XM5\\u2019s provide a deeper and louder bass. The sony XM5\\u2019s provide SLIGHTLY better noise canceling and should not be the overall deciding factor between the two. As far as sound quality, the airpods max takes the cake. You hear very crystal clear notes and voices with the airpods max and you can tell by listening that they are expensive headphones. The XM5 sound quality is great as well but the airpods max sound quality is just that much more better. Build wise, the airpods max are built to last because of its hard outer shell. The airpods max dont have that hard enclosure but thy do have a headband that is very flexible and will not break from any regular wear and tear. Coming from someone who unbiasly has both, i prefer the airpods max and only gave it a 4 star rating for its slight lack of bass. The sony XM5\\u2019s have great bass but arent really comfortable to wear, more specifically, outer ear pain. The ear cup of the sony XM5\\u2019s are not as deep or as large as the airpods max. So even if you have small ears, the xm5\\u2019s earcups can squish up against your ear slightyl but within 20 minutes, that pain and discomfort will be enough for you to want to take them off. Both are quality products and both are winners in their own right. However,i prefer apples airpods max.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"TechHead \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlpsmgqJn-AhUQE1kFHddaAh0QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Great Noise Cancellation But Too HEFTY\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"March 1, 2023\", \"content\": \"Overall, I would recommend, but only if cost and weight are not deciding factors for you.\", \"source\": \"Niko \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlpsmgqJn-AhUQE1kFHddaAh0QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Goodbye Beats\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"March 21, 2023\", \"content\": \"Its just a matter of team before Beats is fully phased out since no one buys them anymore. These AirPod Max have stolen the spotlight. They are very steep in price, but the build quality and sound that comes out of these, makes it worth it. Aside from the weight, the 9 microphones make these feel like you don't have them on - voices/outside sounds are that clear. If you wear glasses, these will hurt after a while from the pressure. After using these for a couple months (without glasses on), they don't hurt when I use them anymore. I guess I just have to position them a certain way where it doesn't make my head hurt. Do not workout in these since they are not water or sweat proof. If you do use them for the gym buy AppleCare so you can get a quick replacement if they stop working. The \\\"bra\\\" that the headphones come with is absolute junk. I'm surprised apple did not come up with a better solution. There are many sleep docks online that you can get for these and I do suggest you do that. Not only for ease of use but so you don't have use the original case and so you don't have to charge these every 1.5 days. With the sleep dock, I charge my headphone to 100% over the weekend, and by Friday, they are close to 10% left. The sad part is these are still hard to find unless you pay full price at the Apple Store.

I have watched multiple YouTube videos and have done several A/B tests between the AirPods Max and my old but rugged and road ready Pioneer HDJ-2000 headphones The Pioneers did their job at multiple gigs and clubs, but the AirPods Max blows them away for sound quality. The low end you hear in movies is something you have to hear to believe. The soundstage that so many talk about is the best I have ever heard in a set of headphones. All that computational audio\\u2014akin to the computations Apple implements in iPhones to create great photos from very small camera sensors\\u2014just about makes bluetooth sound as best as it can. I still have time to determine if I will be keeping them\\u2014and so far they are indeed a keeper! I passed down the AirPods Pro to my son.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"djKaSE \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlpsmgqJn-AhUQE1kFHddaAh0QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Firmware Issues\", \"rating\": 1, \"date\": \"July 17, 2022\", \"content\": \"After owning a few pairs of AirPods and Apple-made Beats headphones with ZERO issues, I thought it would be a good idea to step up and get a pair of these. I bought these to use with my AppleTV after the wife and kid went to sleep at night so I can watch my shows without keeping them awake. They worked great for a couple weeks and then mysteriously developed a connection issue. They will pair with the AppleTV but lose connection every time you shift them on your ears. You can't lift one or both sides off without losing connection. I tried turning off head tracking but it's still the same result. I have to manually restart them to reconnect. Also, I can't pair them to anything other than an Apple product. It doesn't go into pairing mode when I hold the noise cancellation button like it's supposed to. I'm also experiencing battery drain issues while they're in the case. All these issues coincided with the current 4E71 firmware release in May-2022. Now it's mid-July and no new firmware has been released. They are basically useless and have been collecting dust for over two months now while I wait on the new firmware that might fix it. Surely I'm not the only person with these issues. Apple needs to fix this. Other than that, the sound was about the same as my Beats Studio or JBL 660NC headphones. They do have good noise cancellation. Overall these were a waste of $500 and I would not recommend them to anyone.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Zack \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlpsmgqJn-AhUQE1kFHddaAh0QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"I love them\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"October 14, 2022\", \"content\": \"Are they worth $500? Eh, debatable. Am I mad that I bought them? Absolutely not! They are so nice. The sound quality/bass is wonderful. They are definitely a luxury item. They have a good weight to them, they\\u2019re sleek, and most importantly they are very comfortable! I can wear them for hours, unlike my airpod pros that would either fall out constantly or make my ears sore after only an hour or two. Love that you can replace the ear pads too, as I wear makeup a lot and plan on getting a second pair of ear pads for the times I\\u2019m not wearing makeup and/or sweating. I also pop them off and let them air out after wearing them for an extended time as condensation builds up a little inside under the mesh. They hold a charge pretty well too. I wear them daily for several hours and have only charged them twice. I did buy little clear Spigen covers/cases for the ear can (I think that\\u2019s what they\\u2019re called) to protect them from getting scratched or worn as they do tend to clink together when getting them out of the case. If you are on the fence and you can afford the hefty price tag, don\\u2019t hesitate any longer and buy them! I had the same wireless skullcandy headphones for like 8 years before these, and I foresee these lasting a long time with proper care and upkeep.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"AlexisW \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}]", "review_count": 6362},

\"title\": \"Better design, with worse...well, everything else\", \"rating\": 1, \"date\": \"October 11, 2022\", \"content\": \"I bought this 3 months ago, excited to upgrade from my previous Sony headphones. The design has definitely improved, and it feels sturdy despite the slimmer build. It folds flat, nice and compact in the equally sturdy case. There's USB-C support for charging, and it doesn't take too long to charge either -- but that's where the positives end. I'm a longtime fan of Sony headphones, but this pair is definitely my worst. Here's why: - The noise cancelling is really, really bad. I was patient and waited for Sony firmware updates, and while Sony did tweak some of the settings, none of the updates since June have done the headphones any good in terms of noise cancelling *quality*. Sure, the headphones can now automatically change noise cancelling intensity based on location and movement, but the changes are now so jarring and inconsistent, thus making the updates feel more like a massive downgrade. Here's a daily scenario: you walk to your bus stop, the headphones then switch to a different noise cancelling setting because it remembers that your local bus stop is a saved location (and if you haven't saved it, you'll receive an annoying amount of notifications for any of your regular locations, including any bus stops you're regularly at as part of your commute); you get on the bus, and the headphones change to a different noise cancelling intensity...but at every stop, your headphones think that you got off, so the automatic motion detection switches to \\\"walking mode\\\"...imagine this on a 10-stop bus commute, and the number of times your headphones switch from commuting-walking-commuting-walking-commuting... Then imagine the occasional stop because of traffic lights, the occasional roadwork, traffic... For some reason these headphones seem to think that \\\"commuting\\\" means \\\"non-stop fast travel from start to end\\\". Having to constantly tweak the settings on my commutes when I just want to relax and enjoy music or podcast or even just silence is definitely not a good start to the day. - These headphones will occasionally turn off for no reason. Sometimes they restart, sometimes they just turn off without restarting, adding to the endless list of disruptions that you can expect to experience while using these headphones. - It's great that you can easily control volume and playback by swiping on your earcups...so long as you don't rely on the option to connect two devices at a time -- a great feature, but one that often disables (for some odd reason) the ability to use gestures to control playback and volume. You'll never know when this happens, but I can assure you of this -- it *will* happen. - There's the option to use \\\"Spotify Tap\\\", with two open slots, both for the same feature (which is very odd): you can just switch from one Spotify playlist to another Spotify playlist...which one are you switching to? No idea, it just switches it to a random playlist...and I have no idea why this was added as a \\\"feature\\\". - Although Google Assistant is still advertised as a great feature for this pair...it's actually not available. Google have revoked this feature, and it's not even a new announcement, but for some reason Sony still advertises this as a selling point. - No worries if you still want to use a voice assistant function -- there's Alexa...which works...so long as you keep the app open...but if you have the app open on your phone, you may as well just use your phone while you're at it -- which leads me nicely to my final point: These headphones were not meant for you to listen to music or whatever form of entertainment you want to enjoy. These headphones were meant for you to use -- use the app to correct the frequent mistakes, constantly swipe across the earcups and press the buttons to fix the errors, regularly open the Sony app to tweak the settings of your noise cancellation, and hope that you won't have someone around you nudging you about how bad the sound is leaking from your headphones while the volume isn't even at 50%. These headphones are a huge step back for Sony -- sure, they packed a lot of innovation and great tech in it, but with the constant tinkering I've had to resort to these past few months, these headphones feel more like a really expensive gadget to with, and less like a pair of headphones.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"benkellis \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:9751338827610193621_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAnvWgqJn-AhU0ElkFHXB4BMkQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Unbelievable noise canceling! Excellent sound!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 24, 2022\", \"content\": \"If you're looking for the best active noise canceling, over-ear headphones... look no further! The quality of noise canceling is second to none, somehow, Sony has taken the best ANC headphones and improved the ANC! Okay, on to the review. The Sony WH-1000XM5s have amazing sound quality, a nice finish (the black does attract fingerprints, at least at first), very comfortable for extended wear, and easily adjustable. The only thing I wish would have been kept around is the ability to fold the headphones like the previous versions, the case for the XM5s is a bit bulky, but you can clip it to a backpack or slide it into a bag pretty easily. The case also holds an included USB-C charging cable and 3.5mm cable in a magnetically sealed compartment and covers the entirety of your high-end headphones, unlike some of Sony's competitors. The thinner headband is nice, I can't really speak to how it may affect one's hair, but it leaves a smaller headband imprint on my bald head and has a barely there feel to it. The earcups are very comfortable and have ample room, even for those with bigger ears! They retain some of the best features of Sony's other ANC headphones, such as: touch controls on the ear cup, cover-to-speak/hear ambient mode, ANC/Ambient/\\\"normal\\\" mode button, 3.5mm ability, highly adjustability in the Sony Headphones app, auto-mode switching based on activities. The ambient mode has the ability to focus on voices, instead of just the general ambient noise and the ability to adjust the level of the ambient noise let in is a very nice feature to have. Pairing that with the auto-mode switching and \\\"speak-to-chat,\\\" which switches the headphones to voice-focused ambient mode when you begin to speak and turns off after a predetermined (and adjustable) amount of time, make for an amazing set of headphones for working in the office, taking on flights, trains, busses, and walking around. Now, they are not claimed to be water or sweat-resistant or IP rated in any way, kind of a bummer on for headphones that seem as though they'd be a perfect pairing for running or working out, but most of the nicer headphones lack an IP rating. In my testing of them, they've held up to some pretty sweaty runs. I do dry them off immediately and leave them off and out of their case for about an hour afterwards and they look, sound, and function perfectly. Something that each individual will have to decide if they're willing to take that risk with such a nice set of headphones. Overall, I would definitely recommend the Sony WH-100XM5s to those looking for great audio quality for music, videos, and calls with amazing active noise cancelation for the times you wish to be isolated from outside noise. I could see these being a perfect fit for a frequent traveler, a music loving office worker looking to focus, and anyone who likes to head the world around them in excellent clarity while wearing their over-ear headphones! I am absolutely loving these and think they're worth the bump in price from the previous generation (XM4) by improving on the previous generation in all ways except for the ability to fold.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Mike \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:9751338827610193621_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAnvWgqJn-AhU0ElkFHXB4BMkQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Some stuff is good some stuff needs to be improved\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 3, 2022\", \"content\": \"The surface of the arch that fits your head is very thin, this looks good, but it makes it so that the point of contact in your head is minimal. Since only a small part of this surface touches your head, there is a lot of pressure on it, and after an hour, the top of my head starts hurting, and I have to move the ring around throughout the day to avoid this pain, which is very annoying. The headphone comes with sensors which detect if you have them on. It comes with an app where you can choose if to turn the headphones off when you take them off your head by using the sensor. This is amazing for saving batteries meaning you don't have to charge them often because you forgot to turn them off manually. The problem is you can choose a timer for the to turn off and turn off immediately after taking them off, making it very annoying when you want to take your headphones off for multiple reasons like going to the toilet, talking to someone else or simply moving them around to find a more comfortable position, they turn off and if you are in a meeting on slack or teams, skype you will have to go through the process of connecting a device to these apps again which is very annoying. On top of that, I like to put a hoodie on and the headphones on top simply because it makes me feel warm, but the sensor picks that I am not wearing the headphones properly and turns them off; this is super annoying too. The only solution is to turn the feature which turns the headphones off automatically and remember to turn them off manually myself which I always forget and end up having to charge them more often than I would like to. The solution would be to let us put a timer when they should turn off so I could conveniently set them up to turn after 5 minutes of having them off, but alternatively only allow them to turn off if there is no audio playing. This would make it so that I can take them off for short periods of time without having them turned off and so that I could wear them however I want them without turning them off as long as I am listening to music or on a call with someone else. The problem with the small contact point and the pain at the top of my head, well this is a design flaw and I do find myself not wearing them often on purpose if I don't have to due to the discomfort and instead play my laptop speakers. The noise cancelling and audio quality is superb and the ambient mode is decent. I have 10 days to keep them or return them, and I am leaning more towards returning them.

The absence of any quick start guide was frustrating since I didn't have great cell coverage at the time I unboxed the headphones. I didn't know about the controls on the side and the app does not offer any guide either. I am still left in a maze to navigate their website in and out of hyperlinks to figure out which button or surface space does what. For an extremely high price these headphones are less about quality sound and more about noise canceling. If you like great audio, these aren't the headphones for you as they muffle and distort the sound. In general, noise canceling does that so that isn't a complete surprise. An astonishing and ridiculous issue I have with these headphones is that you CANNOT USE THEM WHILE THEY CHARGE?! In this era of device demand, this is a shockingly ignorant choice on the part of Sony. I get it, they might think since wireless earbuds can't be used while charging then who needs to listen to their headphones while they charge? Or perhaps they prioritized a fast charge over listening. The problem with that comes when you quick charge devices over and over again for short periods of time ruining the battery performance. Sony is practically begging you to do that by discouraging you from being able to listen to them at the same time as fully charging them. Overall I appreciate being able to drown out a good amount of background noise but I am left questioning if that's really worth the $400 price tag. If you are looking for noise canceling, pick a pair of great sounding earbuds and skip the actual noise canceling feature, just purchase some flight line ear protection headphones for a much better comfort and outside noise control. You'll save yourself hundreds while having a much lighter pair of headphones that doesn't overheat your ears. Another disappointment of mine was the erroneous idea that connecting to two devices at the same time would mean I could actually listen to two inputs at the same time. Perhaps Bluetooth isn't there yet through no fault of Sony, but I also felt the advertising was misleading on this particular feature and the answer was buried in Bluetooth spec and tech sites and not disclosed on the Sony site. I like that my phone can interrupt my business meeting playing from my computer but I dislike that I cannot listen to ambient sound on Pandora while participating in a business meeting at the same time. Since the audio can't be independently adjusted in noise volume by your individually connected device, you are left with a ring tone set to the same volume as your YouTube video or conversely the YouTube video resumes as loudly as the call and that is mildly annoying.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"AverageListener \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:9751338827610193621_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAnvWgqJn-AhU0ElkFHXB4BMkQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Great upgrade to an already great product\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"June 1, 2022\", \"content\": \"I purchased my first noise cancelling headphones in 2017 and, after a significant amount of research decided on the MDR-1000X. I have been extremely happy with the quality of these products to the extent that I then purchased my wife a pair of WH-1000XM3, the upgraded version of my headphones in 2019. We were both extremely happy with the design, comfort, ease of use and quality of the products. The main reason for purchasing them was for travelling, and making long-haul flights more enjoyable without the distraction of the plane and other background noises. The WH-1000XM5 are, however, a significant step up from these previous products. Firstly, the headphones feel significantly lighter, which is always a plus for travelling. The previous versions used to fold away into their carry case with a bit of twisting, which I always was worried about in case of getting it wrong, having to double check each time that I folded the correct ear. To be fair, it was easy enough, but with this pair, there is no need for this and they simply fold flat back into their case, which makes easier The carry case is a bit bigger, which therefore takes a bit more room in your hand luggage, but has room within it for all cabling (audio and charger), which is a good. I actually think the latest version are more comfortable as well - but it is marginal. I always felt noise cancelling was great on the previous product and it is equally so on the new version. The big plus for me is that there is now no need to run the noise cancelling optimiser for different surroundings. OK, it was fairly simple by pressing a button, but it took about a minute to complete. There is no need for this with the XM5's, as apparently they auto optimise based on your surroundings - which is great. There are other new features that you have to get used to: - the headphones automatically pause what you were listening to when you take them off, and restart when you put them back on - confusing at first when testing, when you think you must have pressed something by accident, but it is a feature which is quite useful - similarly, if you start speaking, the headphones recognise this, pause your music and switch to ambient mode so you can hear - ideal for when you are asked if you want a drink on the plane! Apparently you can pair the headphones to 2 devices simultaneously, in case you are listening to music on a laptop but want to still receive calls!? That is not really relevant for me, so I have not tried it. Battery life is claimed at 30 hours and a 10 minute charge apparently provides 5 hours of battery use. Again, I cannot validate these figures - but have not experienced any issues. In short, they charge quickly and last a long time! Sound quality is pretty important when buying headphones and this is where they come into their own, and I personally think they offer a much fuller sound than my original 1000X, with impressive bass. They are a real step up. In summary, these are really excellent headphones from every perspective and I was pleasantly surprised at how they improved on what I previously thought were perfectly adequate 1000X. I am very happy that I have the new ones, especially as now we can fly again so hopefully I will get chance to use them more often.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"GrenA \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:9751338827610193621_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAnvWgqJn-AhU0ElkFHXB4BMkQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"The BEST just got BETTER!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 27, 2022\", \"content\": \"Sony has done it yet again; they\\u2019ve actually improved upon what I feel are the BEST noise cancelling wireless over-ear headphones available! The WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are the newly released version from Sony and they have added even more user-friendly features and technology than the previous versions\\u2026and updated the look to a more modern design. What\\u2019s in the box - The headphones ship with a great zippered carrying case, a USB-C fast charging cable, an audio cable for wired connection and instructions/paperwork/360 Music offer. The headphones fold much easier compared to the previous versions. There is no more origami-like folding, just turn the ear cups and put them in the case\\u2026which is a good size for traveling. They fit perfectly in the outside pocket of my backpack. The earphones were fully charged out of the box, so all that\\u2019s needed to get started (optional really, as they headphones will connect to your Bluetooth device anyway) is download the Sony Headphones Connect app and set up the earphones. There was a software update available for the headphones and it updated once they were connected. Fit and Function - The first thing I noticed was the new sleeker, more modern looking and lighter design of the XM5s. Although the design has changed, the comfort level is as plush and comfortable as ever. The ear cups and headband are super plush and easy to adjust to your head size. I've been wearing them almost non-stop for the last couple of days and there are no hotspots or uncomfortable rubbing. Hold the power button for a couple of seconds and then the magic starts, the noise canceling technology is fantastic, literally cutting out all the background noise as I mowed the lawn, went running or just listening to music while working around the house (my wife texts me as I can't hear her!). With the Auto Switching Based on Action, the noise cancelling level adjusts to your activity and the outside noise. Sound Quality - The sound quality is the BEST I've ever heard from Bluetooth NC headphones. Straight out of the box these things rock, but the Headphone Connect app gives the user the ability to set custom preferences for sound and services. From a noise canceling perspective Sony touts 8 total microphones and a newly designed 30mm driver to provide optimized noise canceling performance. So the 1000XM5s provide industry leading noise canceling and music that is so crisp and clear on the highs and the bass is rich and deep. Quality sound as expected from Sony! Headphone Connect App - it's a great tool for taking advantage of the many settings these headphones provide like Adaptive Sound Control, Noise Canceling Optimizer, Surround, Equalizer, Sound Quality Mode, Voice Assist, etc. Open the app, turn on the headphones and hold them close to connect and you\\u2019re ready to customize the earphones. The app is broken into four sections: Status, Sound. System and Services. Some of the functions are automatic like the Adaptive Sound Control - this will detect your surroundings and adjust the headphones accordingly. You can also select the Noise Canceling levels. The System tab is all about the operational settings like Auto Power Off, Touch Sensors, etc. Super easy to use and a great tool that\\u2019s very well laid out for the user. Cool (and totally useful) Functions - Not only do these headphones rock, they are loaded with super cool and totally useful Touch Features so you can adjust the music level, FF, Pause, answer phone calls, etc. by simply touching the right ear cup. And if that isn't enough, Sony has upped the game by adding Speak-To-Chat which stops the music and let\\u2019s in ambient sound so you can hold a conversation without having to take the earphones off or cover the right earphone (which still works) as the previous version supported. The other new function that really stands out to me is the Automatic Off (Wearing Detection) feature. By simply taking the headphones off, music is instantly paused until they are put back on\\u2026then the music instantly starts up again automatically. Not sure how Sony will add more features to these headphones in the future\\u2026but I\\u2019m sure they will do something amazing! Phone Calls \\u2013 Sound is great both on the speaker and headphone sides. No complaints from anyone I\\u2019ve talked to on the headphones. Your music will start right back up once the call is ended. Totally hands free and couldn\\u2019t be any easier to use! Battery Life - As mentioned, they came fully charged and after multiple days of use, they are still at 60%...this absolutely crushes the battery performance of my other NC headphones. And on top of that, there\\u2019s a quick charge feature that adds 3 hours of charge in just 3 minutes. Worrying about battery life is completely off the table based on my experience to date. Pros: - Noise Canceling and Sound Quality are second to none - Support for connecting to 2 different devices simultaneously - Ease of adjustability of sound and functions - Touch & Automatic Controls - control your music, pause or call without ever touching your phone - Fit and comfort is outstanding, even after hours of use \\u2013 no hot spots - Sony\\u2019s Headphone Connect App give the user complete control over setup and functionality of headphones - Taking Phone Calls - crisp and clear even in a crowded room - Recycled packaging is a nod to the environment by Sony Cons: - The new case is a bit larger than in the past, not a huge issue, but something that stood out The Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are by far one of my new favorite devices and would 100% recommend them to anyone looking for the BEST noise canceling and function-packed over-the-ear headphones available.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"mstanleynh \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:9751338827610193621_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAnvWgqJn-AhU0ElkFHXB4BMkQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"These might just be as good as it gets..........\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 30, 2022\", \"content\": \"Ok, these are the first 'over the head' high quality wireless headphones I have used and I have to say they have set the bar really high. I have some top end wired Sony Hi Res headphones with no noise cancelling along with some competitors wired noise cancelling headphones and these beauties are on par if not better than both. Firstly the aesthetics are very good, you receive them in a Sony blended material box that might be completely recycled but has a nice solid feel to it and looks nice. Then, when you open up inside is the carry case which may be a bit thicker than I'd like but I'm happy to live with it as it keeps the contents safe. The first view of the WH-1000XM5 is impressive, nice matt finish with classy leather essentials that are very very comfortable indeed and I didn't find my ears getting too hot after 4 hours of continual wear. I'm not sure about all day comfortable but I don't think I could wear any headphones all day. The side panel with all the little tweaks and tricks is a joy to use after looking at the accompanying guide and very quickly becomes intuitive. This is very cleverly done and it seems they were developed with someone who has a similar brain to me because they just work. The sound is really really good with full range and depth, I don't know if I'm imagining it but feel it's not quite as expansive as when they are plugged in via the included cable, that being said Marvin Gaye singing Mercy Mercy Me in Hi Res on my Xperia 5ii is absolutely sublime with all the layers coming through nicely and Marvins smooth voice an utter joy. The noise cancelling is really effective and again the handy side panel enabling you to just hold it to hear is so handy. It makes you feel like it is just you and the music which is exactly what I want. I have used the 360 audio before with other Sony headphones and I have to say these seem to get a bit more out of the separation truly surrounding you with glorious sound. I subjected them to War Of The Worlds Multi Channel and it was absolutely stunning, I was completely lost for the duration, hanging on to Richard Burtons every word and emerged into the story completely. The bluetooth range is outrageously good compared to anything else I have, with the phone in the house I can reach the end of my garden (30m+) with ease and that's on 'Sound quality preferred' setting! All in all I'm struggling to find fault with these at all, maybe the price but realistically is there anything better out there?

Optimised for Alexa and Google Assistant. The headphones are covered in a soft coating leatherette they are very comfortable to wear. One of the first things you notice when you open the box is the environmental packaging It's unbleached and wholly recyclable and uses no plastic whatsoever. The headphones are made mostly from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) which is useful material in acoustic terms which is mostly produced from recycled plastic and can be recycled again at the end of its life. So full marks to Sony for doing this. The Sony WH-1000XM5 main controls use capacitive touch panel on the right ear cup with actions as follows: Swipe Up = Volume Up Swipe Down = Volume Down Swipe Forward = Track forward Swipe Back = Track back Hold (Centre) =Voice assistant Double tap centre= Pause / resume Cup hand =. Ambient sound pass through On the left ear cup you will find two buttons, a power button and ANC mode button.Hold down the power button turns the headphones on after three seconds pairing will start, after that you can pair with your phone/computer. If you press NC/AMB button you can toggle the ANC mode, you are able to select the ANC/ANC off. The Ambient sound mode lets you hear what\\u2019s going on around you. You connect the headphones via Blue tooth or a TRS cable. When you listen to the WH-1000XM5 via the wired connection you turn the headphones on and that enables the ANC or leave them off. They sound quite different in passive mode. At the bottom right is a USB-C Charging port that allows you to charge the headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect App works great with these headphones and I highly recommend that you download it. Also you can get the latest updates for your headphones. Battery life for these Sony headphones is approx 30 hours on a full charge, if the battery is flat you can charge for just 3 minutes you will get 180 minutes of playback or of course you can always use the 3.5mm cable for analog playback. The headphones tend too boost the bass a bit too much with a detriment of the midrange however by using the App you can use the equalisation feature to tailor to your liking. These Sony Headphones support Sony\\u2019s high bit rate codec called LDAC which gives very good sound quality. On using the wired connection I found the sound performance identical to the wireless mode but you need to make sure they are powered on, if you listen in passive mode performance is not so good. The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones sport 8 microphones and the call quality is good and is excellent on zoom calls or phone meetings. It rejects outside noise well.

\"title\": \"Premium Sound\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"September 1, 2022\", \"content\": \"Bose has always been known to make audio products of the highest quality, And Bose\\u2019s newest earbuds the Quietcomfort Earbuds II do NOT disappoint. Packaging: Everything comes included in a small box, right away you can tell that the packaging was very well thought out and designed. Included in the box: Is a USB-A to USB-C cable, an upgrade to the older micro USB-B cable, so I liked that. Also inside the box you will find three different tips that are placed on the earbuds themselves, they come in small, medium and large, already installed are the medium sized ones, These fit the best for me. Also included are \\u201cbands\\u201d these bands wrap around the earbuds themselves. Basically what they do is they form a seal around your ear, These serve two purposes 1. they seal out outside noises out, and 2. They make the earbud fit perfect perfectly inside of your ear canal to protect against the ear buds falling out. Pairing: Connecting the earbuds to my smart phone was really easy, just press the button in the back of the charging case for a couple of seconds, pair them with your smart phone, and that\\u2019s it. Pretty standard and pretty easy. App: You\\u2019ll soon be prompted to download the Bose app. I Recommend everybody do this for couple of reasons, you can play around with the sound EQ settings, you can know exactly how much charge your earbuds have, you can program and swap different shortcuts, and the app can show you very well detailed tips on how to work your new earbuds, meaning it\\u2019ll show you how to pause your music, skip to the next song and raise or lower the volume by simply touching the side of the earbuds with your finger. Finally the thing I appreciate most about this app is that it doesn\\u2019t require you to create any kind of account if you don\\u2019t want to. Sound: The sound is as good as I have ever heard earbuds sound, clean, crisp, excellent highs, excellent mids, and the bass is good enough (these are not super bass heavy) there\\u2019s not much else to say really, these just sound great. Noice Cancelling: Perhaps the single greatest feature of these earbuds have is their sound canceling ability. When in \\u201cQuiet\\u201d mode, The earbuds block out sound better than any earbuds I have ever tried before, then there\\u2019s \\u201cAware\\u201d turn this on if you still want to listen to your music but still be able to hear outside noises (like if you are out in the street and still want to hear cars coming) I think what happens here is the microphone gets turned on and you\\u2019re then able to then hear the outside noises this way, kind of like a hearing aid. Both Quiet mode and Aware mode work very well. Conclusion: I recommend Bose\\u2019s newest earphones to anybody that is reading my review and interested in this product, you will be happy with your purchase. I highly recommend downloading the app and downloading the newest software update for them for the best experience. + Sound + Design + Features +App +The Bands +Comfortable +Battery life -Charging case is made of plastic and feels somewhat cheap\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Ernesto \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4OCgqJn-AhUUF1kFHSbwANEQqSQIfQ\", \"title\": \"Outstanding BOSE sound quailty\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"September 6, 2022\", \"content\": \"We\\u2019ve used a few earbuds in the past, always different brands and were never totally satisfied with the sound quality, \\u201cespecially me with some hearing issues\\u201d.

Took me a while to get them fitting how I liked, especially as the fitment was different to the usual wired earbuds I've used for years, with the ear canal piece being more rectangular than circular. Eventually got them sitting right and the fitment does actually feel better than what I've been used to. Saying that, I often get this little nagging feeling that the left earpiece is going to come loose, and yet it's very much firmly in place if I try to move it about. Tried various combinations of the different sized accessories with no real improvement, but it's a minor quibble, especially as I've used these for home workouts successfully; they've certainly never come close to falling out or anything like that. Noise-cancelling is decent. A lot is made of how class-leading these are in that respect, and I certainly don't think they're anything less than very good in that department, but in terms of blocking out outside noise when there's no audio playing, I don't think they're a clear step-up over what I've been used to. Audio quality is good; definitely an improvement over my various pairs of earbuds I've had, although no better than a pair of popular wireless headphones I have, but then those have much larger drivers, so perhaps an unfair comparison. Only mentioning because I saw someone mention elsewhere that they replaced their OE headphones with a pair of earbuds, and I don't think I'd be doing that myself; these QC IIs are very much for situations where bigger headphones aren't really suitable, such as going outside or exercising/running etc. Bluetooth connection/App seems stable, not had any connectivity issues so far. Actually went into the garage and forgot to take my phone with me, but the signal was still fairly stable, even though I was quite some distance from the source and had several doors/buildings blocking the signal potentially, so I'd have no concerns about dropouts in normal usage, impressive in that regard. Touch controls are simple and effective, although the pause/resume function does \\\"feel\\\" a bit laggy, but that may well be to do with ensuring pausing/resuming gestures aren't mixed up with the next/previous track function. Not a big deal as audio stops promptly if you tap the earbuds, I just have to remind myself to give them a few seconds to resume when I tap them again. I do wish there was a little audio beep or something when adjusting the volume as there is with my headphones. Although speaking of volume, these do need to be at a higher volume level than what I'm used to with other headphones/earbuds that I wear. Overall, a good buy.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"SPZ02 \\u00b7 Review provided by bose.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4OCgqJn-AhUUF1kFHSbwANEQqSQIfQ\", \"title\": \"Excellent Bass, Good Noise Cancelling for Ear Buds\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"December 21, 2022\", \"content\": \"I have always wanted to try Bose headphones knowing them to be a premium brand and having read many reviews. I have gone through a number of ear buds from a range of companies some premium and some more mainstream and always found the sound quality lacking in earbuds style as opposed to over ear designs. When I received my earbuds they were well packaged as you would expect the card case separates to reveal the various components of buds, case, cable and varying size buds and surround seals to ensure a good fit within the ear. As always frustratingly having opened the box everything needs charging so no fun for the first night! Within the pack is the QR code to download the Bose software for both IOA and android devices. Once charged and with software installed the setup was incredibly easy, it found the buds without having to go to settings find devices add pairing codes etc they just connected and then the software guided through the fitting phase to ensure the correct buds and surrounds were fitted. The sound test suggested everything was good to go. WOW was my first impression of sound quality, these little buds really had some good bass, within the app there is an equaliser which lets you change the base mid and treble and I am the sort of person that loves more Bass and Treble. these earbuds did not disappoint in sound quality for sure. Next came the programming of tap which in comparison to other models is more limited as there is basically a choice of which ear for the two settings, double taps, long taps etc are not catered for in this part of the app. The next test was for noise counselling which I have only ever found work fully on over the ear designs at premium prices. The noise cancellation in a normal environment is actually really good for these, it does not cancel everything but it certainly makes a difference and more so than other buds I have had in the past from premium brands. The only fault I have found is when cycling or running in wind conditions this is replicated as white noise slightly while listening to music. I think the only thing I have been disappointed with is the inability to charge the case wirelessly unless I have an incompatible charger this is not a feature of these earbuds as there was no evidence of charging no matter how I laid down the case and this is something I assumed would be the case. Overall these are the best earbuds I have owned so far, they compare with other brands but will still not beat over the ear!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"GEG87 \\u00b7 Review provided by bose.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4OCgqJn-AhUUF1kFHSbwANEQqSQIfQ\", \"title\": \"Another flagship wireless earbuds from Bose\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"December 28, 2022\", \"content\": \"Designing appearances: First of all, the improvement of the charging box is particularly obvious. The charging box of Bose QC Earbuds II returns from the jewelry box style of the previous generation to the design direction of the mainstream TWS earphone charging box, resulting in a smaller size. What's more interesting is that the battery life of the charging box of Bose QC Earbuds II has been upgraded in spite of the reduced size! Wearing experience: The earplugs have undergone substantial alterations. Bose QC Earbuds II divided the previous generation of fish fin earplugs into two sections, the eartips and the stability bands, and called it \\\"Fit Kit ear kit\\\" The meaning of the Fit Kit is to solve the problem of ear fit for different users. You may encounter a certain type of noise-canceling earphones that are recognized as excellent in noise-canceling, but it feels average when it comes to you. The reason for this is probably that the earphones are not well adapted to your ear shape. After all, everyone's ear shape is different, and many people even have differences between their left and right ears. Noise-cancelling capability: Everyone who is familiar with the working principle of noise-cancelling headphones knows that the headphones will analyze and collect sound waves from the external environment, and create a reverse sound wave in the ear to cancel. The current flagship noise-cancelling headphones on the market perform very well in this regard. The Bose QC Earbuds II went a step further on this basis, focusing on the part of the ear, and made a smart in-ear sound field adjustment technology. When you insert the earbuds, you will hear a tone, which means that the smart in-ear sound field adjustment is working. At this time, it will automatically analyze the structure of the wearing ear canal, and then optimize the noise cancellation effect and sound quality of the earphones, thereby realizing \\\"volume customization\\\". Sound quality: The official description, the sound concept of Bose QC Earbuds II is balanced. After actual listening, I personally think it is true. The first impressions are incredibly supple and enduring. Each of the three frequency bands is fairly orderly, and nobody is trying to steal the show. Summarize: If you are looking for noise reduction and wearing comfort, Bose QC Earbuds II will not disappoint you!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"JC \\u00b7 Review provided by johnlewis.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4OCgqJn-AhUUF1kFHSbwANEQqSQIfQ\", \"title\": \"A music producers opinion\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"March 15, 2023\", \"content\": \"After ditching my old amazon bought earbuds and wearing over the had headphones for the better part of a year or so, I finally decided to get myself new earbuds.

These have such good noise cancelling that my wife came behind me while I was doing dishes talking to my and said I could hear her and was just pretending I couldn't hear her, but I really couldn't hear her..... Now for the negative, my wife owns a dog training business and there are a lot of dogs that bark, it does a good job blocking out the barking except the very high pitches which you hear a popping sound, which I heard from interference with certain manufacturer machines that have a high pitch sound also. I do dislike how the left earbud is slave to the right earbud, which means you can't use the earbuds independently, with the right earbud being the master bud. But hopefully they will fix this with a futures update. But what I do LOVE and these earbuds is that I can pause, play, volume up/down, move track forward/backwards, and move between the different ANC seeing simultaneously with the right earbud. This is a phenomenal feature that I believe these are the only earbuds that have. They have definitely improved the Bass in this version and have superior sounds (Sony XM4's still have the best drivers but not much of a difference between these and Don't). Case size is normal for this price range, the obly 2 downsizes is no wireless charging (which I normally never use) and that the earbuds are not magnetic, sometimes they don't get a good connection to charge, but doesn't happen too often). People do complain about the eartip design, which does take a little to get use to, but after having it for a couple weeks, it does help with the ANC. As far as it's shape, I LOVE it. The XM4's, Samsung, and Jabras I would accidently be pressing the buttons taking the earbuds in and out, with these I can mess with them without worrying, which is a stress relieve. Battery life, they are not as good as Jabras, which have the best battery life I have tried yet, but after Jabra, they are are average for the price range. They ANC does drain the battery but as much as other brands, but worth it for how good the ANC is. Price range, the price is about right for what you are getting. Final words, they are the best wireless earbuds I have owned out of multiple brands for what I need. If you want best sound quality, go with the Sony XM4'S the 2022 version, not the /B version (which is having battery drain issues right now due to firmware update). If you want top of the line earbuds in budget I would go with either Jabra or Samsung, which both are GREAT earbuds. But the BOSE have THE BEST ANC, have all controls on the right earbud, great sound quality, and come from a good company. Do they have everything I want? NO, but I won't find an earbud that does. Do I sometimes question these earbuds, yes. Would I buy these again, in a heartbeat. So if you want an overall top of the line for earbuds, these are great! The only reason that I don't give them 5 stars is due to the periodically popping sound, which other earbuds have also (Sony, Dr. Dre) but should be able to be fixed in a software update, which when that happens I will give 5 stars and I am a rough at rating, my wife can tell you that.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"techsavy \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4OCgqJn-AhUUF1kFHSbwANEQqSQIfQ\", \"title\": \"Don't buy Bose at any cost!\", \"rating\": 1, \"date\": \"January 7, 2023\", \"content\": \"I originally bought the Quiet Comfort earbuds in January 2022 which needed replacing and repair about 4 times in a few months (which obviously took up A LOT of time with the admin of talking to JL and going into store etc), until the last time they got sent away where I was told there'd be a week turn around to receive another new pair. Fast forward 6 weeks and they're still 'in progress'. Had to speak to JL (and Bose) directly to find out they had no stock to send my replacement. I was about to give up and get a refund when I suggested I'd try the upgraded pair if JL would offer me that free of charge, which they kindly did (\\u00a330 difference). I received the QC II and had similar problems, left bud always draining of charge or not fully charging, the sound warping between both earbuds, the microphone picking up too much background noise so phone calls outside meant the recipient was not able to hear me, as well as trouble connecting to my phone on every start up, taking about 5-10 mins, putting them back in their case, restarting Bluetooth, opening and closing the app etc. Very inconvenient on the go. Alongside all these defects, the design was off for me. In order to scroll through various noise cancelling levels you can't just hold your finger on the earbud (which also, by the way, didn't fit in my ear properly so fell out multiple times, so-much-so I avoided wearing them when moving a lot), you have to press for ~2 seconds then release for ~2 seconds then press again etc to go through your various modes, which I felt was generally impractical and annoying, especially as it didn't respond to heavy touch but equally didn't with too light a touch. It also meant the right one was even more likely to fall out of my ear. It also made me look like a wannabe Spy. The noise cancelling also broke on the first few pairs I had, and a high pitched whining noise existed when not listening to music. To operate the volume control it requires a swipe, but it never seem to respond properly and would often pause my music or end the call I was on (which is actually the double tap function). All in all, it was a terrible purchase I wish I'd never made, but it was made slightly simpler by the fact the in-store John Lewis Tech team in Bristol made the return easy for me and were very helpful. I am now sworn off Bose for good (I also have a portable speaker which has connective and sound quality issues) but the silver lining is that I would purchase from JL again, knowing that my purchase was protected.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Kitty \\u00b7 Review provided by johnlewis.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4OCgqJn-AhUUF1kFHSbwANEQqSQIfQ\", \"title\": \"amazing sound quality. lacks some features\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"October 5, 2022\", \"content\": \"I rate these headphones a 4 out of 5 mainly because of the sound quality but I have a few things I'm disappointed in especially because of the price point. i really wish the bose name wasn't so large on the side of the earbud it's so distracting wish it was maybe smaller or on an edge. it has no wireless charging BUT that means it weighs less not an issue for me. there is no indication on the case that says anything about the battery and its a bigger case than other types of wireless earbuds but significantly smaller than past bose cases so that's good. there isnt a button that allows you to open the case which means that the case opens too easily also from my experience. the magnets don't really help the case stay closed. the process to pair it is a little difficult. first of all you have to have the app which i don't like and a lot of other wireless headphone don't need an app but if you want to customized your sound quality these are a great option.i like the ear buds that just pair with the phone by Bluetooth but this is definitely very technical The best part about these headphones is that they do live up to the Bose name in terms of noise canceling. It feels like it adjusts to the sound intensity. The quality of calling people is good also because it's very clear. I do agree that the charging time for the earbuds lasts about 6 hours with no issues. Again, you can customize the sound quality on the app. As most earbuds, these come with 3 different soft silicone ear tips and 3 stability bands but for the price I do think there need to be even more tip options for a good fit for everyone These look big in my ears but I was suprised they aren't heavy. I do wish that again for the price point that they would come with the option of over the ear holders too. It seems big but they do have a lot of features especially the swiping on the outside of the earbud wide portion that's unique and there's enough room for your finger to slide easily and a groove to know when to stop You do need to use certain functions on certain earbud and not that can be done on either one. The quiet and aware modes are unique and I'm glad there two options, you may need to play around to get used to them. I personally like the aware mode as it allows for more background noise to get in and I can still pay attention to other things, but there is an area you can change the noise cancelation and tailor it. I think you can only use the voice feature on the right earbud. you can't use one earbud independent of another at the moment uless you leave both outside the case but i did read it may become Available in an update. you also have to be careful with the amplifying power of these earbuds because some sounds are so loud in your ear. personally i do not walk around with earbuds i only use them to work out but would definitely not wear these all the time if I was looking for that option without removingsome of the noise canceling because its so intense almost like wearing earplugs. PLEASE add a find my earbud feature to the app it's really needed!

You know it's working as each bud plays a short note before announcing the device it's paired with, and that announcement goes from being a tad muffled to crystal-clear in the space of a second or less, as the NC is adjusted. Sound Quality The Bose buds have a beefy sound that's underpinned with solid bass, not muddy in any way. The top end can be shrill but is easily moderated with the in-app equalizer. The noise cancellation really helps by removing all distractions and allowing you to focus on the music, it might not be audiophile quality but it is very satisfying. Noise Cancelling Just amazing. I have a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 which were, until now, pretty much unbeatable. The Boses handily trump them. There is some hiss if you have them NC on with no music, in a quiet room, but in any other scenario they are a miracle made flesh, they simply erase what's going on around you better than any other headphone I've heard. The 'aware' mode is great too, people talk about the Apple Airpods Pro as having the best but these are in the same division, passed through noise sounds very natural and that mode doesn't make the music sound tinnier as some others I've heard do. Battery life Good, or rather, normal. 6 hours-ish plus 2 more charges from the case with NC on all the time. Fit and comfort Good, if unusual. There is a pack containing 3 sets of rings and 3 sets of ear tips, the rings help to hold the buds in place and form a seal, the tips do what tips normally do and you can get a perfect fit by mixing and matching them. The app has a sound test you can run to check if you have the best fit, which works perfectly. In my case the defaults were just fine. Once setup, they don't wobble or feel in any way loose Conclusion Amazing.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"ElleCee \\u00b7 Review provided by johnlewis.com\"}]", "review_count": 3258},

\"title\": \"Great for 100% Apple Users\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"June 12, 2022\", \"content\": \"I got these to replace Sony MDR-1000X's (the first generation of the WH-1000XM line), these have a much nicer build quality and appearance than the black Sony's however I think the Noise Cancelling is pretty much the same which is disappointing as the Sony's are now 5 years old. The positives however are that the connection is much easier to manage, the Sony's used to be a pain to get to sync to multiple devices, the AirPods Max are much better in that regard. I'm sure that's mostly the H1 chip and using Apple devices but it's so much more pleasant not to fight Bluetooth to get them to connect. The AirPods Max are clearly designed to emulate the experience of AirPods, they don't have a powerbutton and are meant to be put back in the case after use, and then when removed from case are already connected to your device. They work well in that sense. Where it doesn't make sense though is that the 'smart' case you get is odd, it's not protective but it's also not small enough to pocket, so you end up buying a third party hard case for travelling and then for taking the headphones to work etc you don't take the smart case. The only positive is that the headphones left outside the case still go into their lower power states, but it's just slower to do so than it is in the case. Still, this is a very strange solution for a problem that would have been solved by just having a physical off button, as it is they drain a small amount of battery even if in the case. It feels like Apple being stubborn about maintaining the characteristics of 'AirPods' despite the over ear headphone category having different expectations. I have had issues with them being left a couple of days in the case and getting 'stuck' off and needing to be plugged in to 'revive' them, bizarre, and again, would have been solved with a physical power button. Overall however I like the sound quality and the fit and finish but think they only make sense for users who are 100% inside Apple's ecosystem.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"\\u00b7 Review provided by digitec.ch\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlpsmgqJn-AhUQE1kFHddaAh0QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Great headphones!

If you are looking for clear and balanced sound, these fit the bill. They feel solid in your hands (and heavy on the head) but comfortable to wear (at least for me) for a few hours. Noise cancellation is better than my Sony XM4. Digital crown dial and secondary button does the trick to play, pause, and toggle ANC (Sony did spoil me with the tapping of headset to play/pause but it's fine) Spatial audio is mind blowing and the convenience to easily connect to any Apple device - including the Apple TV is how you're rewarded for being a part of their ecosystem. Sony's way to pair only two devices simultaneously comes at a cost of lower bitrate of music.

I have and love the AirPod Pros for day-to-day with calls, music, audiobooks, and recently been using them on planes for work commuting more and more as the noise canceling is pretty good. I got these because they were on sale and my old pair of Sony WH-1000XM3 (which I loved) were failing, so I figured I would buy these and worst case exchange for Sony headphones if these weren't worth the premium. I watched a lot of reviews, MKBHD had a review and I thought it seemed oversold on sound quality compared to what I thought was really good with the Sony options always, and I was initially underwhelmed and worried I would end up exchanging. Then I let them sit for a bit and settled in and used them for a day or two for my calls/video conferencing and music. I started to realize how much clarity I got without really losing anything. Instead of getting that punchy bass everywhere, you get bass that really acts as emphasis. Vocals are crystal clear. Mic quality is excellent. Comfort wise it is great over long periods. Noise canceling is at least as good (honestly seems better) than other headests I've had. Ambient mode is way better and doesn't have that harsh sound. Only knock on it is if you're doing anything active with them on I feel like the mesh cups do tend to absorb a bit more. The plastic backing makes it a little hard to clean but not impossible. They DO sell replacement ones, so I guess in the long run if it gets bad, it's replaceable. I do wonder the same about the headband material if it will get gross or stretched, but these first few weeks it's so comfortable I find reasons to reach for this headset over listening on other devices, just because I am liking it that much!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"sirkensington \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlpsmgqJn-AhUQE1kFHddaAh0QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Pricey remote work headphones that work fantastic for calls\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"March 16, 2023\", \"content\": \"After seeing all the reviews and videos on the Air pods Max I decided to go with these instead of the Sony XM's because of the many reviews I saw of people feeling a lot of pressure on their head with ANC.\", \"source\": \"MICHELLE \\u00b7 Review provided by nfm.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlpsmgqJn-AhUQE1kFHddaAh0QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Amazing audio.

The Airpods Max are very comfortable for long periods of time. The audio quality is great and crystal clear. It has good bass but not great. The noise canceling does a good job at atopping unwanted noises from interrupting your listening experience. All around, it is a beat of a product. You cannot go wrong with it. I own the XM5\\u2019s and comparing the two, the aipods max are more comfortable but the Sony XM5\\u2019s provide a deeper and louder bass. The sony XM5\\u2019s provide SLIGHTLY better noise canceling and should not be the overall deciding factor between the two. As far as sound quality, the airpods max takes the cake. You hear very crystal clear notes and voices with the airpods max and you can tell by listening that they are expensive headphones. The XM5 sound quality is great as well but the airpods max sound quality is just that much more better. Build wise, the airpods max are built to last because of its hard outer shell. The airpods max dont have that hard enclosure but thy do have a headband that is very flexible and will not break from any regular wear and tear. Coming from someone who unbiasly has both, i prefer the airpods max and only gave it a 4 star rating for its slight lack of bass. The sony XM5\\u2019s have great bass but arent really comfortable to wear, more specifically, outer ear pain. The ear cup of the sony XM5\\u2019s are not as deep or as large as the airpods max. So even if you have small ears, the xm5\\u2019s earcups can squish up against your ear slightyl but within 20 minutes, that pain and discomfort will be enough for you to want to take them off. Both are quality products and both are winners in their own right.

These AirPod Max have stolen the spotlight. They are very steep in price, but the build quality and sound that comes out of these, makes it worth it. Aside from the weight, the 9 microphones make these feel like you don't have them on - voices/outside sounds are that clear. If you wear glasses, these will hurt after a while from the pressure. After using these for a couple months (without glasses on), they don't hurt when I use them anymore. I guess I just have to position them a certain way where it doesn't make my head hurt. Do not workout in these since they are not water or sweat proof. If you do use them for the gym buy AppleCare so you can get a quick replacement if they stop working. The \\\"bra\\\" that the headphones come with is absolute junk. I'm surprised apple did not come up with a better solution. There are many sleep docks online that you can get for these and I do suggest you do that. Not only for ease of use but so you don't have use the original case and so you don't have to charge these every 1.5 days. With the sleep dock, I charge my headphone to 100% over the weekend, and by Friday, they are close to 10% left. The sad part is these are still hard to find unless you pay full price at the Apple Store.

I have watched multiple YouTube videos and have done several A/B tests between the AirPods Max and my old but rugged and road ready Pioneer HDJ-2000 headphones The Pioneers did their job at multiple gigs and clubs, but the AirPods Max blows them away for sound quality.

I bought these to use with my AppleTV after the wife and kid went to sleep at night so I can watch my shows without keeping them awake. They worked great for a couple weeks and then mysteriously developed a connection issue. They will pair with the AppleTV but lose connection every time you shift them on your ears. You can't lift one or both sides off without losing connection. I tried turning off head tracking but it's still the same result. I have to manually restart them to reconnect. Also, I can't pair them to anything other than an Apple product. It doesn't go into pairing mode when I hold the noise cancellation button like it's supposed to. I'm also experiencing battery drain issues while they're in the case. All these issues coincided with the current 4E71 firmware release in May-2022. Now it's mid-July and no new firmware has been released. They are basically useless and have been collecting dust for over two months now while I wait on the new firmware that might fix it. Surely I'm not the only person with these issues. Apple needs to fix this. Other than that, the sound was about the same as my Beats Studio or JBL 660NC headphones. They do have good noise cancellation.

I can wear them for hours, unlike my airpod pros that would either fall out constantly or make my ears sore after only an hour or two. Love that you can replace the ear pads too, as I wear makeup a lot and plan on getting a second pair of ear pads for the times I\\u2019m not wearing makeup and/or sweating. I also pop them off and let them air out after wearing them for an extended time as condensation builds up a little inside under the mesh. They hold a charge pretty well too. I wear them daily for several hours and have only charged them twice. I did buy little clear Spigen covers/cases for the ear can (I think that\\u2019s what they\\u2019re called) to protect them from getting scratched or worn as they do tend to clink together when getting them out of the case.

\"title\": \"Better design, with worse...well, everything else\", \"rating\": 1, \"date\": \"October 11, 2022\", \"content\": \"I bought this 3 months ago, excited to upgrade from my previous Sony headphones. The design has definitely improved, and it feels sturdy despite the slimmer build. It folds flat, nice and compact in the equally sturdy case. There's USB-C support for charging, and it doesn't take too long to charge either -- but that's where the positives end. I'm a longtime fan of Sony headphones, but this pair is definitely my worst. Here's why: - The noise cancelling is really, really bad. I was patient and waited for Sony firmware updates, and while Sony did tweak some of the settings, none of the updates since June have done the headphones any good in terms of noise cancelling *quality*. Sure, the headphones can now automatically change noise cancelling intensity based on location and movement, but the changes are now so jarring and inconsistent, thus making the updates feel more like a massive downgrade. Here's a daily scenario: you walk to your bus stop, the headphones then switch to a different noise cancelling setting because it remembers that your local bus stop is a saved location (and if you haven't saved it, you'll receive an annoying amount of notifications for any of your regular locations, including any bus stops you're regularly at as part of your commute); you get on the bus, and the headphones change to a different noise cancelling intensity...but at every stop, your headphones think that you got off, so the automatic motion detection switches to \\\"walking mode\\\"...imagine this on a 10-stop bus commute, and the number of times your headphones switch from commuting-walking-commuting-walking-commuting... Then imagine the occasional stop because of traffic lights, the occasional roadwork, traffic... For some reason these headphones seem to think that \\\"commuting\\\" means \\\"non-stop fast travel from start to end\\\". Having to constantly tweak the settings on my commutes when I just want to relax and enjoy music or podcast or even just silence is definitely not a good start to the day. - These headphones will occasionally turn off for no reason. Sometimes they restart, sometimes they just turn off without restarting, adding to the endless list of disruptions that you can expect to experience while using these headphones. - It's great that you can easily control volume and playback by swiping on your earcups...so long as you don't rely on the option to connect two devices at a time -- a great feature, but one that often disables (for some odd reason) the ability to use gestures to control playback and volume. You'll never know when this happens, but I can assure you of this -- it *will* happen. - There's the option to use \\\"Spotify Tap\\\", with two open slots, both for the same feature (which is very odd): you can just switch from one Spotify playlist to another Spotify playlist...which one are you switching to? No idea, it just switches it to a random playlist...and I have no idea why this was added as a \\\"feature\\\". - Although Google Assistant is still advertised as a great feature for this pair...it's actually not available. Google have revoked this feature, and it's not even a new announcement, but for some reason Sony still advertises this as a selling point. - No worries if you still want to use a voice assistant function -- there's Alexa...which works...so long as you keep the app open...but if you have the app open on your phone, you may as well just use your phone while you're at it -- which leads me nicely to my final point: These headphones were not meant for you to listen to music or whatever form of entertainment you want to enjoy. These headphones were meant for you to use -- use the app to correct the frequent mistakes, constantly swipe across the earcups and press the buttons to fix the errors, regularly open the Sony app to tweak the settings of your noise cancellation, and hope that you won't have someone around you nudging you about how bad the sound is leaking from your headphones while the volume isn't even at 50%. These headphones are a huge step back for Sony -- sure, they packed a lot of innovation and great tech in it, but with the constant tinkering I've had to resort to these past few months, these headphones feel more like a really expensive gadget to with, and less like a pair of headphones.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"benkellis \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:9751338827610193621_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAnvWgqJn-AhU0ElkFHXB4BMkQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Unbelievable noise canceling! Excellent sound!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 24, 2022\", \"content\": \"If you're looking for the best active noise canceling, over-ear headphones... look no further! The quality of noise canceling is second to none, somehow, Sony has taken the best ANC headphones and improved the ANC! Okay, on to the review. The Sony WH-1000XM5s have amazing sound quality, a nice finish (the black does attract fingerprints, at least at first), very comfortable for extended wear, and easily adjustable. The only thing I wish would have been kept around is the ability to fold the headphones like the previous versions, the case for the XM5s is a bit bulky, but you can clip it to a backpack or slide it into a bag pretty easily. The case also holds an included USB-C charging cable and 3.5mm cable in a magnetically sealed compartment and covers the entirety of your high-end headphones, unlike some of Sony's competitors. The thinner headband is nice, I can't really speak to how it may affect one's hair, but it leaves a smaller headband imprint on my bald head and has a barely there feel to it. The earcups are very comfortable and have ample room, even for those with bigger ears! They retain some of the best features of Sony's other ANC headphones, such as: touch controls on the ear cup, cover-to-speak/hear ambient mode, ANC/Ambient/\\\"normal\\\" mode button, 3.5mm ability, highly adjustability in the Sony Headphones app, auto-mode switching based on activities. The ambient mode has the ability to focus on voices, instead of just the general ambient noise and the ability to adjust the level of the ambient noise let in is a very nice feature to have. Pairing that with the auto-mode switching and \\\"speak-to-chat,\\\" which switches the headphones to voice-focused ambient mode when you begin to speak and turns off after a predetermined (and adjustable) amount of time, make for an amazing set of headphones for working in the office, taking on flights, trains, busses, and walking around. Now, they are not claimed to be water or sweat-resistant or IP rated in any way, kind of a bummer on for headphones that seem as though they'd be a perfect pairing for running or working out, but most of the nicer headphones lack an IP rating. In my testing of them, they've held up to some pretty sweaty runs. I do dry them off immediately and leave them off and out of their case for about an hour afterwards and they look, sound, and function perfectly. Something that each individual will have to decide if they're willing to take that risk with such a nice set of headphones. Overall, I would definitely recommend the Sony WH-100XM5s to those looking for great audio quality for music, videos, and calls with amazing active noise cancelation for the times you wish to be isolated from outside noise. I could see these being a perfect fit for a frequent traveler, a music loving office worker looking to focus, and anyone who likes to head the world around them in excellent clarity while wearing their over-ear headphones! I am absolutely loving these and think they're worth the bump in price from the previous generation (XM4) by improving on the previous generation in all ways except for the ability to fold.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Mike \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:9751338827610193621_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAnvWgqJn-AhU0ElkFHXB4BMkQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Some stuff is good some stuff needs to be improved\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 3, 2022\", \"content\": \"The surface of the arch that fits your head is very thin, this looks good, but it makes it so that the point of contact in your head is minimal. Since only a small part of this surface touches your head, there is a lot of pressure on it, and after an hour, the top of my head starts hurting, and I have to move the ring around throughout the day to avoid this pain, which is very annoying. The headphone comes with sensors which detect if you have them on. It comes with an app where you can choose if to turn the headphones off when you take them off your head by using the sensor. This is amazing for saving batteries meaning you don't have to charge them often because you forgot to turn them off manually. The problem is you can choose a timer for the to turn off and turn off immediately after taking them off, making it very annoying when you want to take your headphones off for multiple reasons like going to the toilet, talking to someone else or simply moving them around to find a more comfortable position, they turn off and if you are in a meeting on slack or teams, skype you will have to go through the process of connecting a device to these apps again which is very annoying. On top of that, I like to put a hoodie on and the headphones on top simply because it makes me feel warm, but the sensor picks that I am not wearing the headphones properly and turns them off; this is super annoying too. The only solution is to turn the feature which turns the headphones off automatically and remember to turn them off manually myself which I always forget and end up having to charge them more often than I would like to. The solution would be to let us put a timer when they should turn off so I could conveniently set them up to turn after 5 minutes of having them off, but alternatively only allow them to turn off if there is no audio playing. This would make it so that I can take them off for short periods of time without having them turned off and so that I could wear them however I want them without turning them off as long as I am listening to music or on a call with someone else. The problem with the small contact point and the pain at the top of my head, well this is a design flaw and I do find myself not wearing them often on purpose if I don't have to due to the discomfort and instead play my laptop speakers. The noise cancelling and audio quality is superb and the ambient mode is decent. I have 10 days to keep them or return them, and I am leaning more towards returning them. Will see.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Rafacast7 \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:9751338827610193621_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAnvWgqJn-AhU0ElkFHXB4BMkQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"As advertised but missing some big basic features\", \"rating\": 3, \"date\": \"March 24, 2023\", \"content\": \"I found the reviews to be a bit too thorough as if they are paid advertisements that only echo online reviews by compensated individuals. The absence of any quick start guide was frustrating since I didn't have great cell coverage at the time I unboxed the headphones. I didn't know about the controls on the side and the app does not offer any guide either. I am still left in a maze to navigate their website in and out of hyperlinks to figure out which button or surface space does what. For an extremely high price these headphones are less about quality sound and more about noise canceling. If you like great audio, these aren't the headphones for you as they muffle and distort the sound. In general, noise canceling does that so that isn't a complete surprise. An astonishing and ridiculous issue I have with these headphones is that you CANNOT USE THEM WHILE THEY CHARGE?! In this era of device demand, this is a shockingly ignorant choice on the part of Sony. I get it, they might think since wireless earbuds can't be used while charging then who needs to listen to their headphones while they charge? Or perhaps they prioritized a fast charge over listening. The problem with that comes when you quick charge devices over and over again for short periods of time ruining the battery performance. Sony is practically begging you to do that by discouraging you from being able to listen to them at the same time as fully charging them. Overall I appreciate being able to drown out a good amount of background noise but I am left questioning if that's really worth the $400 price tag. If you are looking for noise canceling, pick a pair of great sounding earbuds and skip the actual noise canceling feature, just purchase some flight line ear protection headphones for a much better comfort and outside noise control. You'll save yourself hundreds while having a much lighter pair of headphones that doesn't overheat your ears. Another disappointment of mine was the erroneous idea that connecting to two devices at the same time would mean I could actually listen to two inputs at the same time. Perhaps Bluetooth isn't there yet through no fault of Sony, but I also felt the advertising was misleading on this particular feature and the answer was buried in Bluetooth spec and tech sites and not disclosed on the Sony site. I like that my phone can interrupt my business meeting playing from my computer but I dislike that I cannot listen to ambient sound on Pandora while participating in a business meeting at the same time. Since the audio can't be independently adjusted in noise volume by your individually connected device, you are left with a ring tone set to the same volume as your YouTube video or conversely the YouTube video resumes as loudly as the call and that is mildly annoying.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"AverageListener \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:9751338827610193621_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAnvWgqJn-AhU0ElkFHXB4BMkQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Great upgrade to an already great product\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"June 1, 2022\", \"content\": \"I purchased my first noise cancelling headphones in 2017 and, after a significant amount of research decided on the MDR-1000X. I have been extremely happy with the quality of these products to the extent that I then purchased my wife a pair of WH-1000XM3, the upgraded version of my headphones in 2019. We were both extremely happy with the design, comfort, ease of use and quality of the products. The main reason for purchasing them was for travelling, and making long-haul flights more enjoyable without the distraction of the plane and other background noises. The WH-1000XM5 are, however, a significant step up from these previous products. Firstly, the headphones feel significantly lighter, which is always a plus for travelling. The previous versions used to fold away into their carry case with a bit of twisting, which I always was worried about in case of getting it wrong, having to double check each time that I folded the correct ear. To be fair, it was easy enough, but with this pair, there is no need for this and they simply fold flat back into their case, which makes easier The carry case is a bit bigger, which therefore takes a bit more room in your hand luggage, but has room within it for all cabling (audio and charger), which is a good. I actually think the latest version are more comfortable as well - but it is marginal. I always felt noise cancelling was great on the previous product and it is equally so on the new version. The big plus for me is that there is now no need to run the noise cancelling optimiser for different surroundings. OK, it was fairly simple by pressing a button, but it took about a minute to complete. There is no need for this with the XM5's, as apparently they auto optimise based on your surroundings - which is great. There are other new features that you have to get used to: - the headphones automatically pause what you were listening to when you take them off, and restart when you put them back on - confusing at first when testing, when you think you must have pressed something by accident, but it is a feature which is quite useful - similarly, if you start speaking, the headphones recognise this, pause your music and switch to ambient mode so you can hear - ideal for when you are asked if you want a drink on the plane! Apparently you can pair the headphones to 2 devices simultaneously, in case you are listening to music on a laptop but want to still receive calls!? That is not really relevant for me, so I have not tried it. Battery life is claimed at 30 hours and a 10 minute charge apparently provides 5 hours of battery use. Again, I cannot validate these figures - but have not experienced any issues. In short, they charge quickly and last a long time! Sound quality is pretty important when buying headphones and this is where they come into their own, and I personally think they offer a much fuller sound than my original 1000X, with impressive bass. They are a real step up. In summary, these are really excellent headphones from every perspective and I was pleasantly surprised at how they improved on what I previously thought were perfectly adequate 1000X. I am very happy that I have the new ones, especially as now we can fly again so hopefully I will get chance to use them more often.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"GrenA \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:9751338827610193621_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAnvWgqJn-AhU0ElkFHXB4BMkQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"The BEST just got BETTER!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 27, 2022\", \"content\": \"Sony has done it yet again; they\\u2019ve actually improved upon what I feel are the BEST noise cancelling wireless over-ear headphones available! The WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are the newly released version from Sony and they have added even more user-friendly features and technology than the previous versions\\u2026and updated the look to a more modern design. What\\u2019s in the box - The headphones ship with a great zippered carrying case, a USB-C fast charging cable, an audio cable for wired connection and instructions/paperwork/360 Music offer. The headphones fold much easier compared to the previous versions. There is no more origami-like folding, just turn the ear cups and put them in the case\\u2026which is a good size for traveling. They fit perfectly in the outside pocket of my backpack. The earphones were fully charged out of the box, so all that\\u2019s needed to get started (optional really, as they headphones will connect to your Bluetooth device anyway) is download the Sony Headphones Connect app and set up the earphones. There was a software update available for the headphones and it updated once they were connected. Fit and Function - The first thing I noticed was the new sleeker, more modern looking and lighter design of the XM5s. Although the design has changed, the comfort level is as plush and comfortable as ever. The ear cups and headband are super plush and easy to adjust to your head size. I've been wearing them almost non-stop for the last couple of days and there are no hotspots or uncomfortable rubbing. Hold the power button for a couple of seconds and then the magic starts, the noise canceling technology is fantastic, literally cutting out all the background noise as I mowed the lawn, went running or just listening to music while working around the house (my wife texts me as I can't hear her!). With the Auto Switching Based on Action, the noise cancelling level adjusts to your activity and the outside noise. Sound Quality - The sound quality is the BEST I've ever heard from Bluetooth NC headphones. Straight out of the box these things rock, but the Headphone Connect app gives the user the ability to set custom preferences for sound and services. From a noise canceling perspective Sony touts 8 total microphones and a newly designed 30mm driver to provide optimized noise canceling performance. So the 1000XM5s provide industry leading noise canceling and music that is so crisp and clear on the highs and the bass is rich and deep. Quality sound as expected from Sony! Headphone Connect App - it's a great tool for taking advantage of the many settings these headphones provide like Adaptive Sound Control, Noise Canceling Optimizer, Surround, Equalizer, Sound Quality Mode, Voice Assist, etc. Open the app, turn on the headphones and hold them close to connect and you\\u2019re ready to customize the earphones. The app is broken into four sections: Status, Sound. System and Services. Some of the functions are automatic like the Adaptive Sound Control - this will detect your surroundings and adjust the headphones accordingly. You can also select the Noise Canceling levels. The System tab is all about the operational settings like Auto Power Off, Touch Sensors, etc. Super easy to use and a great tool that\\u2019s very well laid out for the user. Cool (and totally useful) Functions - Not only do these headphones rock, they are loaded with super cool and totally useful Touch Features so you can adjust the music level, FF, Pause, answer phone calls, etc. by simply touching the right ear cup. And if that isn't enough, Sony has upped the game by adding Speak-To-Chat which stops the music and let\\u2019s in ambient sound so you can hold a conversation without having to take the earphones off or cover the right earphone (which still works) as the previous version supported. The other new function that really stands out to me is the Automatic Off (Wearing Detection) feature. By simply taking the headphones off, music is instantly paused until they are put back on\\u2026then the music instantly starts up again automatically. Not sure how Sony will add more features to these headphones in the future\\u2026but I\\u2019m sure they will do something amazing! Phone Calls \\u2013 Sound is great both on the speaker and headphone sides. No complaints from anyone I\\u2019ve talked to on the headphones. Your music will start right back up once the call is ended. Totally hands free and couldn\\u2019t be any easier to use! Battery Life - As mentioned, they came fully charged and after multiple days of use, they are still at 60%...this absolutely crushes the battery performance of my other NC headphones. And on top of that, there\\u2019s a quick charge feature that adds 3 hours of charge in just 3 minutes. Worrying about battery life is completely off the table based on my experience to date. Pros: - Noise Canceling and Sound Quality are second to none - Support for connecting to 2 different devices simultaneously - Ease of adjustability of sound and functions - Touch & Automatic Controls - control your music, pause or call without ever touching your phone - Fit and comfort is outstanding, even after hours of use \\u2013 no hot spots - Sony\\u2019s Headphone Connect App give the user complete control over setup and functionality of headphones - Taking Phone Calls - crisp and clear even in a crowded room - Recycled packaging is a nod to the environment by Sony Cons: - The new case is a bit larger than in the past, not a huge issue, but something that stood out The Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are by far one of my new favorite devices and would 100% recommend them to anyone looking for the BEST noise canceling and function-packed over-the-ear headphones available.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"mstanleynh \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:9751338827610193621_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAnvWgqJn-AhU0ElkFHXB4BMkQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"These might just be as good as it gets..........\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 30, 2022\", \"content\": \"Ok, these are the first 'over the head' high quality wireless headphones I have used and I have to say they have set the bar really high. I have some top end wired Sony Hi Res headphones with no noise cancelling along with some competitors wired noise cancelling headphones and these beauties are on par if not better than both. Firstly the aesthetics are very good, you receive them in a Sony blended material box that might be completely recycled but has a nice solid feel to it and looks nice. Then, when you open up inside is the carry case which may be a bit thicker than I'd like but I'm happy to live with it as it keeps the contents safe. The first view of the WH-1000XM5 is impressive, nice matt finish with classy leather essentials that are very very comfortable indeed and I didn't find my ears getting too hot after 4 hours of continual wear. I'm not sure about all day comfortable but I don't think I could wear any headphones all day. The side panel with all the little tweaks and tricks is a joy to use after looking at the accompanying guide and very quickly becomes intuitive. This is very cleverly done and it seems they were developed with someone who has a similar brain to me because they just work. The sound is really really good with full range and depth, I don't know if I'm imagining it but feel it's not quite as expansive as when they are plugged in via the included cable, that being said Marvin Gaye singing Mercy Mercy Me in Hi Res on my Xperia 5ii is absolutely sublime with all the layers coming through nicely and Marvins smooth voice an utter joy. The noise cancelling is really effective and again the handy side panel enabling you to just hold it to hear is so handy. It makes you feel like it is just you and the music which is exactly what I want. I have used the 360 audio before with other Sony headphones and I have to say these seem to get a bit more out of the separation truly surrounding you with glorious sound. I subjected them to War Of The Worlds Multi Channel and it was absolutely stunning, I was completely lost for the duration, hanging on to Richard Burtons every word and emerged into the story completely. The bluetooth range is outrageously good compared to anything else I have, with the phone in the house I can reach the end of my garden (30m+) with ease and that's on 'Sound quality preferred' setting! All in all I'm struggling to find fault with these at all, maybe the price but realistically is there anything better out there? I'm not sure there is.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"occasionalstan \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:9751338827610193621_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAnvWgqJn-AhU0ElkFHXB4BMkQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Much improved sound quality and comfort\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 27, 2022\", \"content\": \"Sony have excelled once again improving from the previous WH-1000XM4 headphones which I didn't think was possible.

Optimised for Alexa and Google Assistant. The headphones are covered in a soft coating leatherette they are very comfortable to wear. One of the first things you notice when you open the box is the environmental packaging It's unbleached and wholly recyclable and uses no plastic whatsoever. The headphones are made mostly from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) which is useful material in acoustic terms which is mostly produced from recycled plastic and can be recycled again at the end of its life. So full marks to Sony for doing this. The Sony WH-1000XM5 main controls use capacitive touch panel on the right ear cup with actions as follows: Swipe Up = Volume Up Swipe Down = Volume Down Swipe Forward = Track forward Swipe Back = Track back Hold (Centre) =Voice assistant Double tap centre= Pause / resume Cup hand =. Ambient sound pass through On the left ear cup you will find two buttons, a power button and ANC mode button.Hold down the power button turns the headphones on after three seconds pairing will start, after that you can pair with your phone/computer. If you press NC/AMB button you can toggle the ANC mode, you are able to select the ANC/ANC off. The Ambient sound mode lets you hear what\\u2019s going on around you. You connect the headphones via Blue tooth or a TRS cable. When you listen to the WH-1000XM5 via the wired connection you turn the headphones on and that enables the ANC or leave them off. They sound quite different in passive mode. At the bottom right is a USB-C Charging port that allows you to charge the headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect App works great with these headphones and I highly recommend that you download it. Also you can get the latest updates for your headphones. Battery life for these Sony headphones is approx 30 hours on a full charge, if the battery is flat you can charge for just 3 minutes you will get 180 minutes of playback or of course you can always use the 3.5mm cable for analog playback. The headphones tend too boost the bass a bit too much with a detriment of the midrange however by using the App you can use the equalisation feature to tailor to your liking. These Sony Headphones support Sony\\u2019s high bit rate codec called LDAC which gives very good sound quality. On using the wired connection I found the sound performance identical to the wireless mode but you need to make sure they are powered on, if you listen in passive mode performance is not so good. The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones sport 8 microphones and the call quality is good and is excellent on zoom calls or phone meetings. It rejects outside noise well.

\"title\": \"Premium Sound\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"September 1, 2022\", \"content\": \"Bose has always been known to make audio products of the highest quality, And Bose\\u2019s newest earbuds the Quietcomfort Earbuds II do NOT disappoint. Packaging: Everything comes included in a small box, right away you can tell that the packaging was very well thought out and designed. Included in the box: Is a USB-A to USB-C cable, an upgrade to the older micro USB-B cable, so I liked that. Also inside the box you will find three different tips that are placed on the earbuds themselves, they come in small, medium and large, already installed are the medium sized ones, These fit the best for me. Also included are \\u201cbands\\u201d these bands wrap around the earbuds themselves. Basically what they do is they form a seal around your ear, These serve two purposes 1. they seal out outside noises out, and 2. They make the earbud fit perfect perfectly inside of your ear canal to protect against the ear buds falling out. Pairing: Connecting the earbuds to my smart phone was really easy, just press the button in the back of the charging case for a couple of seconds, pair them with your smart phone, and that\\u2019s it. Pretty standard and pretty easy. App: You\\u2019ll soon be prompted to download the Bose app. I Recommend everybody do this for couple of reasons, you can play around with the sound EQ settings, you can know exactly how much charge your earbuds have, you can program and swap different shortcuts, and the app can show you very well detailed tips on how to work your new earbuds, meaning it\\u2019ll show you how to pause your music, skip to the next song and raise or lower the volume by simply touching the side of the earbuds with your finger. Finally the thing I appreciate most about this app is that it doesn\\u2019t require you to create any kind of account if you don\\u2019t want to. Sound: The sound is as good as I have ever heard earbuds sound, clean, crisp, excellent highs, excellent mids, and the bass is good enough (these are not super bass heavy) there\\u2019s not much else to say really, these just sound great. Noice Cancelling: Perhaps the single greatest feature of these earbuds have is their sound canceling ability. When in \\u201cQuiet\\u201d mode, The earbuds block out sound better than any earbuds I have ever tried before, then there\\u2019s \\u201cAware\\u201d turn this on if you still want to listen to your music but still be able to hear outside noises (like if you are out in the street and still want to hear cars coming) I think what happens here is the microphone gets turned on and you\\u2019re then able to then hear the outside noises this way, kind of like a hearing aid. Both Quiet mode and Aware mode work very well. Conclusion: I recommend Bose\\u2019s newest earphones to anybody that is reading my review and interested in this product, you will be happy with your purchase. I highly recommend downloading the app and downloading the newest software update for them for the best experience. + Sound + Design + Features +App +The Bands +Comfortable +Battery life -Charging case is made of plastic and feels somewhat cheap\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Ernesto \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4OCgqJn-AhUUF1kFHSbwANEQqSQIfQ\", \"title\": \"Outstanding BOSE sound quailty\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"September 6, 2022\", \"content\": \"We\\u2019ve used a few earbuds in the past, always different brands and were never totally satisfied with the sound quality, \\u201cespecially me with some hearing issues\\u201d.

Took me a while to get them fitting how I liked, especially as the fitment was different to the usual wired earbuds I've used for years, with the ear canal piece being more rectangular than circular. Eventually got them sitting right and the fitment does actually feel better than what I've been used to. Saying that, I often get this little nagging feeling that the left earpiece is going to come loose, and yet it's very much firmly in place if I try to move it about. Tried various combinations of the different sized accessories with no real improvement, but it's a minor quibble, especially as I've used these for home workouts successfully; they've certainly never come close to falling out or anything like that. Noise-cancelling is decent. A lot is made of how class-leading these are in that respect, and I certainly don't think they're anything less than very good in that department, but in terms of blocking out outside noise when there's no audio playing, I don't think they're a clear step-up over what I've been used to. Audio quality is good; definitely an improvement over my various pairs of earbuds I've had, although no better than a pair of popular wireless headphones I have, but then those have much larger drivers, so perhaps an unfair comparison. Only mentioning because I saw someone mention elsewhere that they replaced their OE headphones with a pair of earbuds, and I don't think I'd be doing that myself; these QC IIs are very much for situations where bigger headphones aren't really suitable, such as going outside or exercising/running etc. Bluetooth connection/App seems stable, not had any connectivity issues so far. Actually went into the garage and forgot to take my phone with me, but the signal was still fairly stable, even though I was quite some distance from the source and had several doors/buildings blocking the signal potentially, so I'd have no concerns about dropouts in normal usage, impressive in that regard. Touch controls are simple and effective, although the pause/resume function does \\\"feel\\\" a bit laggy, but that may well be to do with ensuring pausing/resuming gestures aren't mixed up with the next/previous track function. Not a big deal as audio stops promptly if you tap the earbuds, I just have to remind myself to give them a few seconds to resume when I tap them again. I do wish there was a little audio beep or something when adjusting the volume as there is with my headphones. Although speaking of volume, these do need to be at a higher volume level than what I'm used to with other headphones/earbuds that I wear. Overall, a good buy.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"SPZ02 \\u00b7 Review provided by bose.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4OCgqJn-AhUUF1kFHSbwANEQqSQIfQ\", \"title\": \"Excellent Bass, Good Noise Cancelling for Ear Buds\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"December 21, 2022\", \"content\": \"I have always wanted to try Bose headphones knowing them to be a premium brand and having read many reviews. I have gone through a number of ear buds from a range of companies some premium and some more mainstream and always found the sound quality lacking in earbuds style as opposed to over ear designs. When I received my earbuds they were well packaged as you would expect the card case separates to reveal the various components of buds, case, cable and varying size buds and surround seals to ensure a good fit within the ear. As always frustratingly having opened the box everything needs charging so no fun for the first night! Within the pack is the QR code to download the Bose software for both IOA and android devices. Once charged and with software installed the setup was incredibly easy, it found the buds without having to go to settings find devices add pairing codes etc they just connected and then the software guided through the fitting phase to ensure the correct buds and surrounds were fitted. The sound test suggested everything was good to go. WOW was my first impression of sound quality, these little buds really had some good bass, within the app there is an equaliser which lets you change the base mid and treble and I am the sort of person that loves more Bass and Treble. these earbuds did not disappoint in sound quality for sure. Next came the programming of tap which in comparison to other models is more limited as there is basically a choice of which ear for the two settings, double taps, long taps etc are not catered for in this part of the app. The next test was for noise counselling which I have only ever found work fully on over the ear designs at premium prices. The noise cancellation in a normal environment is actually really good for these, it does not cancel everything but it certainly makes a difference and more so than other buds I have had in the past from premium brands. The only fault I have found is when cycling or running in wind conditions this is replicated as white noise slightly while listening to music. I think the only thing I have been disappointed with is the inability to charge the case wirelessly unless I have an incompatible charger this is not a feature of these earbuds as there was no evidence of charging no matter how I laid down the case and this is something I assumed would be the case. Overall these are the best earbuds I have owned so far, they compare with other brands but will still not beat over the ear!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"GEG87 \\u00b7 Review provided by bose.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4OCgqJn-AhUUF1kFHSbwANEQqSQIfQ\", \"title\": \"Another flagship wireless earbuds from Bose\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"December 28, 2022\", \"content\": \"Designing appearances: First of all, the improvement of the charging box is particularly obvious. The charging box of Bose QC Earbuds II returns from the jewelry box style of the previous generation to the design direction of the mainstream TWS earphone charging box, resulting in a smaller size. What's more interesting is that the battery life of the charging box of Bose QC Earbuds II has been upgraded in spite of the reduced size! Wearing experience: The earplugs have undergone substantial alterations. Bose QC Earbuds II divided the previous generation of fish fin earplugs into two sections, the eartips and the stability bands, and called it \\\"Fit Kit ear kit\\\" The meaning of the Fit Kit is to solve the problem of ear fit for different users. You may encounter a certain type of noise-canceling earphones that are recognized as excellent in noise-canceling, but it feels average when it comes to you. The reason for this is probably that the earphones are not well adapted to your ear shape. After all, everyone's ear shape is different, and many people even have differences between their left and right ears. Noise-cancelling capability: Everyone who is familiar with the working principle of noise-cancelling headphones knows that the headphones will analyze and collect sound waves from the external environment, and create a reverse sound wave in the ear to cancel. The current flagship noise-cancelling headphones on the market perform very well in this regard. The Bose QC Earbuds II went a step further on this basis, focusing on the part of the ear, and made a smart in-ear sound field adjustment technology. When you insert the earbuds, you will hear a tone, which means that the smart in-ear sound field adjustment is working. At this time, it will automatically analyze the structure of the wearing ear canal, and then optimize the noise cancellation effect and sound quality of the earphones, thereby realizing \\\"volume customization\\\". Sound quality: The official description, the sound concept of Bose QC Earbuds II is balanced. After actual listening, I personally think it is true. The first impressions are incredibly supple and enduring. Each of the three frequency bands is fairly orderly, and nobody is trying to steal the show. Summarize: If you are looking for noise reduction and wearing comfort, Bose QC Earbuds II will not disappoint you!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"JC \\u00b7 Review provided by johnlewis.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4OCgqJn-AhUUF1kFHSbwANEQqSQIfQ\", \"title\": \"A music producers opinion\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"March 15, 2023\", \"content\": \"After ditching my old amazon bought earbuds and wearing over the had headphones for the better part of a year or so, I finally decided to get myself new earbuds.

These have such good noise cancelling that my wife came behind me while I was doing dishes talking to my and said I could hear her and was just pretending I couldn't hear her, but I really couldn't hear her..... Now for the negative, my wife owns a dog training business and there are a lot of dogs that bark, it does a good job blocking out the barking except the very high pitches which you hear a popping sound, which I heard from interference with certain manufacturer machines that have a high pitch sound also. I do dislike how the left earbud is slave to the right earbud, which means you can't use the earbuds independently, with the right earbud being the master bud. But hopefully they will fix this with a futures update. But what I do LOVE and these earbuds is that I can pause, play, volume up/down, move track forward/backwards, and move between the different ANC seeing simultaneously with the right earbud. This is a phenomenal feature that I believe these are the only earbuds that have. They have definitely improved the Bass in this version and have superior sounds (Sony XM4's still have the best drivers but not much of a difference between these and Don't). Case size is normal for this price range, the obly 2 downsizes is no wireless charging (which I normally never use) and that the earbuds are not magnetic, sometimes they don't get a good connection to charge, but doesn't happen too often). People do complain about the eartip design, which does take a little to get use to, but after having it for a couple weeks, it does help with the ANC. As far as it's shape, I LOVE it. The XM4's, Samsung, and Jabras I would accidently be pressing the buttons taking the earbuds in and out, with these I can mess with them without worrying, which is a stress relieve. Battery life, they are not as good as Jabras, which have the best battery life I have tried yet, but after Jabra, they are are average for the price range. They ANC does drain the battery but as much as other brands, but worth it for how good the ANC is. Price range, the price is about right for what you are getting. Final words, they are the best wireless earbuds I have owned out of multiple brands for what I need. If you want best sound quality, go with the Sony XM4'S the 2022 version, not the /B version (which is having battery drain issues right now due to firmware update). If you want top of the line earbuds in budget I would go with either Jabra or Samsung, which both are GREAT earbuds. But the BOSE have THE BEST ANC, have all controls on the right earbud, great sound quality, and come from a good company. Do they have everything I want? NO, but I won't find an earbud that does. Do I sometimes question these earbuds, yes. Would I buy these again, in a heartbeat. So if you want an overall top of the line for earbuds, these are great! The only reason that I don't give them 5 stars is due to the periodically popping sound, which other earbuds have also (Sony, Dr. Dre) but should be able to be fixed in a software update, which when that happens I will give 5 stars and I am a rough at rating, my wife can tell you that.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"techsavy \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4OCgqJn-AhUUF1kFHSbwANEQqSQIfQ\", \"title\": \"Don't buy Bose at any cost!\", \"rating\": 1, \"date\": \"January 7, 2023\", \"content\": \"I originally bought the Quiet Comfort earbuds in January 2022 which needed replacing and repair about 4 times in a few months (which obviously took up A LOT of time with the admin of talking to JL and going into store etc), until the last time they got sent away where I was told there'd be a week turn around to receive another new pair. Fast forward 6 weeks and they're still 'in progress'. Had to speak to JL (and Bose) directly to find out they had no stock to send my replacement. I was about to give up and get a refund when I suggested I'd try the upgraded pair if JL would offer me that free of charge, which they kindly did (\\u00a330 difference). I received the QC II and had similar problems, left bud always draining of charge or not fully charging, the sound warping between both earbuds, the microphone picking up too much background noise so phone calls outside meant the recipient was not able to hear me, as well as trouble connecting to my phone on every start up, taking about 5-10 mins, putting them back in their case, restarting Bluetooth, opening and closing the app etc. Very inconvenient on the go. Alongside all these defects, the design was off for me. In order to scroll through various noise cancelling levels you can't just hold your finger on the earbud (which also, by the way, didn't fit in my ear properly so fell out multiple times, so-much-so I avoided wearing them when moving a lot), you have to press for ~2 seconds then release for ~2 seconds then press again etc to go through your various modes, which I felt was generally impractical and annoying, especially as it didn't respond to heavy touch but equally didn't with too light a touch. It also meant the right one was even more likely to fall out of my ear. It also made me look like a wannabe Spy. The noise cancelling also broke on the first few pairs I had, and a high pitched whining noise existed when not listening to music. To operate the volume control it requires a swipe, but it never seem to respond properly and would often pause my music or end the call I was on (which is actually the double tap function). All in all, it was a terrible purchase I wish I'd never made, but it was made slightly simpler by the fact the in-store John Lewis Tech team in Bristol made the return easy for me and were very helpful. I am now sworn off Bose for good (I also have a portable speaker which has connective and sound quality issues) but the silver lining is that I would purchase from JL again, knowing that my purchase was protected.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Kitty \\u00b7 Review provided by johnlewis.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4OCgqJn-AhUUF1kFHSbwANEQqSQIfQ\", \"title\": \"amazing sound quality. lacks some features\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"October 5, 2022\", \"content\": \"I rate these headphones a 4 out of 5 mainly because of the sound quality but I have a few things I'm disappointed in especially because of the price point. i really wish the bose name wasn't so large on the side of the earbud it's so distracting wish it was maybe smaller or on an edge. it has no wireless charging BUT that means it weighs less not an issue for me. there is no indication on the case that says anything about the battery and its a bigger case than other types of wireless earbuds but significantly smaller than past bose cases so that's good. there isnt a button that allows you to open the case which means that the case opens too easily also from my experience. the magnets don't really help the case stay closed. the process to pair it is a little difficult. first of all you have to have the app which i don't like and a lot of other wireless headphone don't need an app but if you want to customized your sound quality these are a great option.i like the ear buds that just pair with the phone by Bluetooth but this is definitely very technical The best part about these headphones is that they do live up to the Bose name in terms of noise canceling. It feels like it adjusts to the sound intensity. The quality of calling people is good also because it's very clear. I do agree that the charging time for the earbuds lasts about 6 hours with no issues. Again, you can customize the sound quality on the app. As most earbuds, these come with 3 different soft silicone ear tips and 3 stability bands but for the price I do think there need to be even more tip options for a good fit for everyone These look big in my ears but I was suprised they aren't heavy. I do wish that again for the price point that they would come with the option of over the ear holders too. It seems big but they do have a lot of features especially the swiping on the outside of the earbud wide portion that's unique and there's enough room for your finger to slide easily and a groove to know when to stop You do need to use certain functions on certain earbud and not that can be done on either one. The quiet and aware modes are unique and I'm glad there two options, you may need to play around to get used to them. I personally like the aware mode as it allows for more background noise to get in and I can still pay attention to other things, but there is an area you can change the noise cancelation and tailor it. I think you can only use the voice feature on the right earbud. you can't use one earbud independent of another at the moment uless you leave both outside the case but i did read it may become Available in an update. you also have to be careful with the amplifying power of these earbuds because some sounds are so loud in your ear. personally i do not walk around with earbuds i only use them to work out but would definitely not wear these all the time if I was looking for that option without removingsome of the noise canceling because its so intense almost like wearing earplugs.

You know it's working as each bud plays a short note before announcing the device it's paired with, and that announcement goes from being a tad muffled to crystal-clear in the space of a second or less, as the NC is adjusted. Sound Quality The Bose buds have a beefy sound that's underpinned with solid bass, not muddy in any way. The top end can be shrill but is easily moderated with the in-app equalizer. The noise cancellation really helps by removing all distractions and allowing you to focus on the music, it might not be audiophile quality but it is very satisfying. Noise Cancelling Just amazing. I have a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 which were, until now, pretty much unbeatable. The Boses handily trump them. There is some hiss if you have them NC on with no music, in a quiet room, but in any other scenario they are a miracle made flesh, they simply erase what's going on around you better than any other headphone I've heard. The 'aware' mode is great too, people talk about the Apple Airpods Pro as having the best but these are in the same division, passed through noise sounds very natural and that mode doesn't make the music sound tinnier as some others I've heard do. Battery life Good, or rather, normal. 6 hours-ish plus 2 more charges from the case with NC on all the time. Fit and comfort Good, if unusual. There is a pack containing 3 sets of rings and 3 sets of ear tips, the rings help to hold the buds in place and form a seal, the tips do what tips normally do and you can get a perfect fit by mixing and matching them.

Susvara - If I could characterize this headphone tonally, it would be as a symbol- the Yin Yang. Befitting considering it\\u2019s heritage. This headphone is perfectly balanced. And as such, I believe HiFiman created the most timbre accurate headphone I\\u2019ve heard. The Susvara is the only headphone I\\u2019ve listened to that crosses the uncanny valley completely from reproduction to believability and because of this, it\\u2019s performance is more than the sum of it\\u2019s parts. If I had one gripe, it would be that the imaging isn\\u2019t as precise as a Focal. Though this does lends a certain etherealness to it that is arguably just as interesting as perfect imaging.\\n\\n2. Focal Utopia (OG, I haven\\u2019t heard the new one yet) - The best imaging headphone I\\u2019ve heard. Approached perfection in many ways but never crossed the valley because of Focal\\u2019s house sound. This is Focal\\u2019s best headphone and strikes the best balance in their lineup.\\n\\n3. Abyss AB-1266 - Perhaps the most fun you can have without taking your clothes off. It\\u2019s like hiring a world class prostitute. None of this is natural, but it\\u2019s fucking great.\\n\\n4. Focal Clear Mg - I agree with OP. This headphone is dynamic incarnate. It\\u2019s more dynamic than the Utopia. At some point it felt like kick drums would punch a hole straight through my eardrum, in a good way. Considered this might have been my endgame for awhile but ultimately the mids are fucked- particularly male vocals. I did find out the weird tonality does lend itself to reproducing the timbre of water perfectly for some reason. Still the best rendition of Yosi\\u2019s Fluid that I\\u2019ve heard so far. Combined with Focal\\u2019s best-in-the-world imaging, it does it better than the Susvara.\\n\\n5. KSC75 - Minus the sub bass, tonally amazing. Also the soundstage is just shocking- goes way past the headphones somehow. I feel like this headphone grounds us in a world of ever escalating prices. I never get tired of listening to these and still do often.\", \"Oops, the new Utopia should really take a spot up there. I haven't had a lot of time with those, so they escaped my mind for a moment.\", \"1. Senn HE-1: Tried it for 10 minutes. Cannot describe the sound, hope it breaks my wallet (and possibly my neck) one day. The only electrostatic headphone that I really enjoy.\\n2. Hifiman SUSvara: Just like u/radrod69 said, jack of all trades, master of none.\\n3. Beyer DT1990: Wasn't looking forward to them after seeing FR graph, now using daily for detail and imaging\\n4. Senn HD560s and similar looking ones: Really comfortable for me. Using for everything that isn't critical listening. 560s sounds dull, 598/558 has too much mid bass and lower mids. Eq isn't an option because it's being used on a lot of devices.\\n5. Focal Clear OG: Utopia would probably go here if I didn't literally forget how it sounds...\\n6. Audio Technica R70X: I prefer this over senn's he6 line. I don't prefer the flappy wings though.\\n7. Hifiman HE1000v2: A mad scientist tweaked Arya into a detailed monster. Also comes with the drawbacks of a detailed monster.\\n8. Hifiman Arya SE: I don't know why I like HE1000v2 more.\\n9. Meze elite: Sounds so soothing. Would be so much better if it had better resolution or a smaller price tag...\\n10.

Stax SR-009: the god of details, love the airiness and precision, although can get a bit fatiguing for longer listening\\n2. LCD-2F: smooth and damn pleasant to listen to every time I put them on, slightly forward in the mids but it never feels grating\\n3. Koss ESP950: pretty much do nothing wrong, although sometimes feel lacking in extensions in both ends\\n4. Audio Technica ATH-W5000: what I reach for for acoustic, jazz, jpop, etc; they are not hard to drive but more picky with amp synergy than most\\n5. AKG-K400: these surprise me every time I take them for a spin against more expensive cans, very natural sound, super nice soundstage. Slapped a pair of K601 pads on them and I can listen for hours with no fatigue\\n6. Beyer T1 gen 1: these are great out of an OTL tube amp, balanced sound with a slight coloration in the upper mids\\n7. Ultrasone Signature Pro: fit can be a bit finicky sometimes and affect the soundstage, surprisingly I like them quite a lot for classical and ambient\\n8. Senn HD650: nice tonality, clamping force is a little high but very comfy otherwise\\n9. Senn HD800: great once eq\\u2019d but I am lukewarm about the tonality\\n10. Grado RS2: maybe the best grado I\\u2019ve tried, feel more balanced than the RS1 to me, very energetic and fun\", \"Let's see, I've owned quite a few headphones, and I've demoed more, so I'll give this one a shot. Some demos were done months ago, and often for only a few minutes, so this is just from memory.\\n\\n1. Hifiman Shangri-La Jr. Superlative in comfort, sound, and style. My favorite tuning thus far: airy, bright, yet smooth. Vocals, particularly female vocals, take on this thinner, breathy, \\\"delicate/angelic\\\" sound, which I often like. Bass has some sense of punch and responds well to EQ. Absolutely no regrets buying this one.\\n2. Hifiman HE-1000v2. Very similar overall to the SGL Jr, I just really like the Hifiman sound. A bit more bass, the treble is a bit rougher, and the soundstage is different. Comfort is great too, though the earcup extends maybe a bit too far down.\\n3. Meze Elite. Only demoed them for a bit, but the sound was full and rich, with lots of energy in the bass and midrange. It was comfortable to listen to sound-wise. Unfortunately, my ears stick out too much and were squished against the metal driver mesh, which was a bit uncomfortable.\\n4. LCD-X 2021. Smooth and bassy sound, probably the darkest headphone that I could enjoy listening to. All around good option, and it's more comfortable than its weight would imply.\\n5. Stax SR-L700mk2. Very unusual tuning, but it works well for some genres. With a bit of a bass boost, it becomes much more tolerable for a wider variety of music. It's sort of a lowercase-mu-shaped sound, and just needs a bit more bass to shine. Also, it's soundstage is quite unusual and asymmetrical, which works well for live stage-based recordings. I haven't heard anything with that sort of soundstage elsewhere.\\n6. Hifiman Arya Stealth. It's got that usual Hifiman open-back tuning, but it lacks some refinement in the upper mids and treble that the HE-1000v2/SGL Jr have. There's just some harshness there. Excellent headphone otherwise.\\n7. Focal Utopia (older). The only Focal that I've tried that wasn't immediately uncomfortable. It has a very energetic sound, lots of bass punch and slam, but possibly the weirdest imaging I've heard. Like in one song, there's a little rustle that normally renders diagonally behind my left ear. On the Utopia, it was like inside my left eye socket. Very odd, but a great headphone nonetheless.\\n8. Audeze CRBN. This is an outlier amongst electrostatics. Small soundstage, big and punchy bass, plenty of note weight similar to an Audeze planar. Somewhat strident in the midrange, particularly with female vocals, and this trait is shared with the MM-500, so I think it's a \\\"new Audeze\\\" feature. Kind of bulky too. Treble seemed a bit grainy at times compared to the other 2 estats on this list. An estat for people who don't like estats.\\n9. Dan Clark Audio Aeon 2 Noire. Well-tuned portable closed-back planar. Decently comfortable, though for some reason it doesn't work that well for my head shape through a combination of unusual pad shape, higher clamp pressure, and a thin, stiff, and narrow headband strap. Generally a good Harman-esque tuning, though quite bright in the upper treble even for me. Bass is elevated, but occasionally lacking in punch, depending on how the track is mastered.\\n10. Hifiman HE-R7DX. Sort of a surprising entry, even to myself, showing that good stuff exists at all price brackets. Light and mostly comfortable (big ears strike again!), with minimal clamp force. Good and punchy bass to me despite not sealing well on my head. Emphasized midrange combines with an elevated, though peaky, treble to create an energetic sound. The main problems are that the sound can change quite a bit based on fit, the treble peaks may disagree with someone else (they don't bother me very much), and it's very difficult to EQ. Certain notches in the FR are practically impossible to erase via EQ boosts. This is a love-or-hate headphone, and I got lucky.\", \"I'm not very good at describing sound, so my list will just be the names of headphones.

to get better at focusing and so obviously a pair of noise cancelling headphones is the way to guarantee this and so in this video we're going to be testing these top six noise cancelling headphones to figure out which of these is the best on the market and which of these i am going to buy for myself now the cool thing is we actually have a whole range of these in different price points we have the ridiculously cheap anchor sound cores we have the microsoft surface headphone 2. we have the sony wh xm 1000 m4 or something like that we have the bose qc700s we have the apple airport max and we have the stupidly expensive b and o b o plate h95 and so for each of these what we did is that i tested them extensively myself and we got a few team members to test them all as well and we're going to rate them all in terms of aesthetics in terms of fit and comfort in terms of noise cancellation and in terms of sound quality for music now as you know i'm a fan of upfront conclusions so i'm just going to come out and say that the ones i'll be getting are the sony wh mx4s whatever they're called if you're on a budget the anker sound cores are actually surprisingly reasonable and if you don't care about long-term comfort and are happy to spend a bit more money the apple airpods maxes are the choice for you so if that's all you wanted from the video then thank you very much for watching and do please have a great rest of day but now we're going to go over these one at a time and i'm going to share the pros and the cons of each of these six pairs of headphones and i'll show the results of my personal and our team testing about the various factors so that whichever one of these you're buying you can make hopefully a slightly more informed decision about the noise canceling headphones that are obviously going to change your life so we're going to start with the cheapest ones and these are the anker soundcore q30s which retail for about 100 and if you're on a budget these are actually a really good option and probably the best value for money that you can get in terms of the noise cancellation headphone wireless headphone market their design is a little bit plasticky and flimsy and they come with this sound core case thing which again is nothing to write home about it's got these little cheapy cheap looking pieces of foam in it as well but to be honest for the price it's not bad at all in terms of fit and comfort it's actually pretty reasonable in terms of looks these did get the lowest rating from our team members and from me with most of us rating it either a one or two for an average rating of 1.5 stars in terms of looks but in terms of fit and comfort they're actually pretty reasonable and most of us rated them a four or three so this got a rating of 3.5 in terms of fit and comfort now when it comes to noise cancellation i'm gonna be honest like i tested these fairly extensively and i didn't really notice much of a difference between the noise cancelling capabilities of the different headphones in fairness we are in this fairly quiet environment if i was in an airplane or on a train or in the london underground maybe the noise cancelling test would have been better but as far as i could really tell they were all fairly similar in terms of noise cancelling ability but in terms of sound quality there were some noticeable differences between the six headphones in the lineup the sound is pretty good but i'm not like wowed by it i'm still getting that kind of like cheap feel and these ones clocked in fairly reasonably with an average rating of 3.75 stars across our team the battery life on these is absolutely incredible it's 40 hours apparently with noise cancelling and 60 hours if you turn off the noise cancelling and they've got a few buttons on the bottom where you can increase the volume or decrease the volume or hit play and pause again these are nothing to write home about but if for example you're a student and you're on a budget and you do want a pair of noise cancelling headphones to make it easier to focus when you're working or if you're in a coffee shop or whatever then these are by far the best value for money and they also fall down nicely and can go kind of go into this case and you can shove this little piece of plastic in there somewhere if you really want to but yeah fairly reasonable option if you are on a budget moving up a little bit in terms of price point we now have the microsoft surface headphones too which retail for around about 270 dollars now in terms of aesthetics i actually quite like these especially because they're this sort of silvery whitey kind of color and i'm a fan of things that look white broadly and they have these interesting features in that on both knobs you can like turn the knobs so one of the knobs is full volume and the other knob is for the noise cancellation ability of the headphones allegedly they have multi-device support and so they can connect to two devices at once and allegedly it can switch between your iphone and your macbook if it recognizes you're getting a phone call in practice this feature does not work like it has never once actually worked as intended for me and in terms of battery life it's fairly low it's got around about 18 hours of battery life which means you do have to charge it somewhat regularly if you're going to be using it extensively for long work sessions in terms of aesthetics i gave this a five star rating but some of the team gave it a three and four star so the average rating of this was four stars and in terms of fit and comfort it's actually very reasonable i've got fives and fours across the board with an average rating of 4.3 stars but sadly in terms of sound quality these are just not as good as some of the alternatives so i gave this personally a three out of five in terms of sound quality which was kind of what the team thought as well so this had an average rating of 3.3 stars in terms of music quality so i actually used to use these for about six months in 2021 and i really liked them mostly because of the aesthetic they were quite nice to be honest i hadn't a b tested them with a bunch of different headphones to be honest all these review videos are somewhat artificial because once you have one of these headphones it doesn't really matter which one you have you kind of then just get used to it and that becomes the new normal it's only when you really compare them side by side with like kind of six other headphones that you start to quibble about things like noise quality but broadly i was a big fan of them um when i had them and i like the fact that they came with this nice little case which meant i could just chuck it in my bag and the case had a nice little slot for the cables as well then sadly my tesla got broken into and these got stolen so this is just a pair that we ordered for review purposes but after testing them side by side with all the others i've decided that i'm no longer going to be using the microsoft surface headphones too because the sonys are just a little bit better than them across all fronts except the aesthetics anyway that brings us on to the sony what are they called the sony wh-1000xm4s this is the only real problem with these is that it's impossible to remember what the name is sony really needs to come up with a better way of naming these headphones but they are the ones that i'm going to be now switching to because i think they're the perfect mix of comfort and sound quality and noise cancellation and battery life even if the aesthetic is just slightly less nice than the microsoft surface headphones too now in terms of fit and comfort these actually were the best headphones that we tested they were the most comfortable buy a reasonable margin decent very comfortable most comfortable yet and i think the main reason for that is that these are just so light they are i think probably the lightest out of the six headphones that we've tested although i haven't measured it just on my head they feel really light and when it comes to wearing these for extended periods of time really the comfort correlates strongly with how heavy the headphones are or rather how light the headphones are because the main problem with the airpods max for example like they're amazing in sound quality they're amazing in battery life they're amazing across all fronts it's just that they're really heavy and after like an hour of using them my head starts to hurt from having such heavy headphones on it and so the fact that the sony's are so comfortable to wear for very extended periods of time i think it's mostly down to just how light they are in terms of looks yeah they're not bad the team thought they were five stars and four stars in terms of looks i'd personally rate them a three star because i do prefer the look of the microsoft surface headphones but i mean they're very reasonable they look like just a normal pair of noise cancelling headphones nothing to write home about and in terms of design they fold up nicely like this so it's very easy to pack into a bag and they also come with this little carry case that if you want you can put them in i'm probably not going to do that because that's too much faff i'm just probably going to stick them in my bag exactly like that they charge like all these do by usbc that's pretty standard and unsurprisingly they've got a power button and a button that lets you control the level of noise cancellation in terms of battery life these are actually really good they're advertised as having 30 hours of battery life with the noise cancellation and 38 hours without noise cancellation if you're not into noise cancellation for whatever reason and in terms of sound quality for listening to music i personally thought these were really good i gave them a four star rating sadly this was not mirrored by our team who thought they were more like two stars and three stars in terms of noise quality and so the overall rating for this in terms of sound quality is 3.5 stars but personally i think that's a little bit of an under estimate of what's the actual i say actual my my personal subjective interpretation of their their music quality was and to be honest this sort of subjectiveness you get a lot when it comes to testing headphones like i'm not an audiophile no one in our team is really an audiophile and so we don't objectively know what these headphones sound like all we can say is what our subjective experience like oh this sounds a bit better than that and after doing a bunch of hot swapping to be like are these really sounding better than the surface are these really sounding better than the boses i kind of decided at the end that like yeah whenever i put these on my head i felt ah these are so comfortable and i also felt that oh the sound quality on these is pretty good yeah not as good as the airpods max airplanes backs max wins across the board just blew everyone else out of the water in terms of sound quality but i don't think that trade-off is warranted given how heavy they are and therefore how uncomfortable they are for long periods of time at least for me and so the sony's are the ones that i'm going to be holding on to i haven't figured out whether i want them in white or silver or in blue i'm not too much of a fan of this matte black color but hey they're really good and these are now going to be a staple part of my everyday carry all right now we're spending a little bit more money and we come to the bose qc 700s which retail for 350 but these are a little bit more expensive than the sony's and actually i think the main selling point is the look it does look quite nice um our team was a bit uh split on whether we liked this particular style with these like yeah it's just a slightly different design to most noise cancelling headphones i personally quite like them but in terms of comfort they're not quite as good as the sony's and in terms of sound quality for me also they're not quite as good as the sony's our team rated these pretty poorly across the board so this got an average of 3.25 stars when it came to fit and comfort it got a three stars in terms of noise cancellation and it got a 3.1 stars in terms of sound quality and a 3.2 stars in terms of look so like broadly if we averaged the four four five four four team members that we had testing these broadly we weren't a fan these are actually the ones i've been using for the last six months since my tesla got broken into and i lost my microsoft surface headphones too i've actually been using these but i'm going to give them away to a friend and instead replace them with the sony's because the sony's are marginally better in terms of comfort and in terms of sound quality next we come to the apple airpod maxes which are really expensive and retail for around about 640 dollars at least if you convert the pounds we'll put the actual dollar price over here now these come with the case but we have two team members gordon angus in our studio who use these and they never carry the case with them similarly when i used to use the apple airpods max i never carry the case because the case is totally pointless and genuinely these are really good the sound quality is just way better than all of the other headphones that we tested and when you put these on you immediately think oh my god this sounds incredible compared to the other noise cancelling headphones and anyway it kind of screws up your mind a bit or your ear rather because it makes you think that the others sound bad in comparison to this but then after a while of getting used to the others you stop you you kind of forget what it was like to wear the apple airpods max this is probably the best sounding of them all the sound is amazing the design is a bit polarizing i quite like the blue color personally rather than the black and they've got this little mesh thing at the top which is kind of comfortable but the main thing the main drawback of these as i've said is that they're just too heavy they're very comfortable for short amounts of time but for more than about half an hour i started to find my kind of ears getting a bit tired my head getting a bit tired maybe i'm not hench enough to handle these but i just i just really wasn't a fan in terms of long-term comfort levels now if you have apple devices these are actually really good because there is a chip or something inside them that makes them pair with iphones and macs really easily so you can literally just wear them and they will automatically pair to your iphone or to your mac and really that means that there isn't actually a way of turning them off the way they go into standby mode is when you put them in the case but given that realistically no one really carries the case around because it's kind of useless it does have that slight quirk to them it's got a little button at the top which acts as a little sort of volume dial and also if you press the button down you can access siri but the issue is that these are the only phones that don't have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack so if you listen to stuff on airplanes a lot and you want to plug your headphones into the aeroplane system thingy so that you can watch a movie on the aeroplane using your fancy noise canceling headphones you can do that with all the others but you can't do it with the apple airpods max this is not a huge problem like to be honest these were the clear winners in most of the categories in terms of comfort so yeah great pair of headphones super expensive but you do get fantastic sound quality for that but they are not for me because i just can't handle them in terms of the heaviness and the discomfort and finally we come to the big daddies the b o b o play h95s which are ridiculously expensive these come in at 940 or thereabouts and they have they have these like leather thingies around them i think you can actually take these off yeah you can take them off they have leather around them they have this leather thing at the top so it's like a more premium higher end feel to these noise canceling headphones but sadly they are just not very good in terms of the aesthetics our team was a bit split on them i quite like these metal bits and i would have even liked the nordic ice color because these come in a multitude of colors and that color looks really cool but again they run into into the same issue that the airpods max do in that they are quite heavy and so wearing them for extended periods of time can actually get a little bit uncomfortable sound quality as well again it's reasonable most of our team rated them somewhere between three and four stars i would just thought that the sound would be better for this price so the sound quality doesn't feel amazing i thought these were a three star personally i did personally prefer the sound quality of the sony's despite the fact that these are like triple the price but i guess what you're really paying for here is the sort of more premium leather feel of the noise cancelling headphones and to be honest i liked the nordic ice color at least on the website so much that if these were slightly lighter i probably would have gone for these just to have the flecks of like having a really nicely aesthetic pair of headphones sadly they're not comfortable enough to even warrant that so basically i'm not a fan of these despite them being quite expensive and quite high-end oh the other cool thing about them is that they do come in this fancy like metal case thing which feels feels very high-end feels very premium makes you think feel healed oh sick but it's also a case that's quite heavy by itself and so it's not a case that you're really going to be carrying in a backpack it's more for the kind of aesthetics of the unboxing experience and so that you can feel oh i'm a legend because i wear bang olufsen noise canceling headphones now in terms of practical uses of these noise canceling headphones there's three main domains that have made up the bulk of my use of these over the last few years firstly it's listening to my study with me playlist on spotify while i'm trying to work or focus or do any kind of deep work at all second it's consuming things like music and podcast and audiobooks while i'm on things like trains and airplanes because the noise canceling is really helpful and thirdly i find these noise canceling headphones really helpful if i'm editing videos because then with the noise cancelling i can edit videos wherever i go and speaking of editing videos another tool that i find incredibly helpful is called storyblocks who are very kindly sponsoring this video i've been using storyblocks since i started this youtube channel five years ago in 2017. droidblocks is absolutely fantastic it is a subscription service that gives you royalty-free stock photos and stock videos and stock music that you can use in youtube videos just like this one in fact when we got team members to test out the headphones some of the tracks we were using were from storyblocks royalty free so that we can include them in this video without getting copyright stricken for them me and our editors personally find storyblocks super helpful when we're trying to find b-roll and especially in the early days of this youtube channel when i was trying to juggle making videos with the demands of being a medical student and later the demands of being a doctor it was super helpful to have this library of high quality stock footage available to use as b-roll so that i didn't necessarily have to go out and spend hours and hours shooting my own b-roll for all the videos that i was making and other than just videos and music storyblocks also has things like after effect templates and premiere pro templates for titles lower thirds transitions and even sound effects that you can incorporate into your videos whenever you want storyblocks has subscriptions for any budget and so if you want to check it out then do hit the link in the video description so thank you so much storyblocks for sponsoring this video and for helping out the channel over the last five years so overall when it comes to these headphones the budget pick is the anker sound cores which are very reasonable my personal pick is the sony wh mx1000 xm4s or whatever they're called and if you don't care about the comfort thing the airpods maxes are by far the best ones in terms of sound quality if you like this video you might be interested in what sort of podcasts i listen to with my fancy pair of noise cancelling headphones and that'll be in a video over there called 20 podcasts that made me millionaire so thank you so much for watching and i'll see you in the next video bye \"}, {\"title\": \"Top 5 BEST Headphones of [2023] - YouTube\", \"link\":

testing I've put together a list of options that'll meet the needs of different types of buyers so whether it's price performance or its particular use we've got you covered for more information on the products I've included links in the description box down below which are updated for the best prices like the video comment and don't forget to subscribe now let's get started we'll start our list of reviews with the Bose QuietComfort 45 which in our opinion are the best noise canceling headphones available on the market in 2023 they resemble their predecessor and look and feel and have active noise cancellation ANC technology that is particularly effective in blocking external sounds overall they perform very well with a neutral sound profile 21 plus hours of continuous playback and an extremely comfortable fit they're easy to use and Incredibly comfortable of course the Bose QuietComfort 45 have a few new tricks up their sleeves one of them is the ambient to wear mode which allows us to hear sounds around us at the push of a button along with improved noise cancellation technology that's more sensitive than before luckily they include fast charging which allows you to charge them up in the morning before heading out for work the design remains consistent the Leather Ear cushions and padded foam Bridge give the headphones a nice elegant feel while also being lightweight weighing only 238 grams making them comfortable to wear for long periods of time when not worn around the neck they easily store in the included carrying case as they rotate and fold to fit into it perfectly Bose has equipped a quiet Comfort 45 with simple controls placed on either ear cup pause play buttons on one side and volume up and down buttons on the other side along with the button for their aware mode that lets Ambient sound filter through without having to take off your headphones connecting them is an effortless task as both the 2.5 to 3.5 millimeter trrs connection found in the box or Bluetooth 5.1 Hardware hidden behind Works equally well allowing you to connect them with your smartphone or other sources seamlessly the sound character is dominated by medium and high frequencies making it suitable for podcasts or music that have strong vocal components ultimately reproducing brighter tones that are easy on your ears thumbs up that's for sure the next product in our review list is the Sennheiser momentum 4 wireless also known as the best sounding headphones in 2023 these headphones have all the latest features including battery life and sound better than Sony's XM series Sennheiser has gone from creating a design just for headphone enthusiasts to one that'll appeal to a mass audience from those who work from home to airplane commuters the momentum 4 wireless is comfortable to wear all day long no tight crowns sweaty ears or other fatigue inducing elements operating them is easy too press one button for three seconds to power it up or down while other controls such as play pause skip forward backward and volume control are placed on the right ear cup surface there's even an amp with decent functionality that lets you set ANC to automatically or manually alter its Effectiveness the connectivity of these headphones is excellent too with Bluetooth 5 and an impressively long range you won't experience any issues there as for battery life you're looking at 60 hours with ANC on and more when it's off a remarkable autonomy that surpasses even the best headphones out there noise cancellation performance of the momentum Wireless 4 works great in practice and should make most users pretty happy the sound quality is something else entirely refined based detail and presence no other brand can match deep melodic bass sure to please audio files plus treble that boasts articulation detail and texture like none other this is a quality product and all we can do is recommend it if you're looking for headphones that'll provide you with even greater value for money we especially recommend the Jabra Elite 45h these are compact Bluetooth headphones with ear cushions available at a very affordable price there is no active noise cancellation at this price but it promises a stratospheric 50 hours of battery life all under the watchful eye if your jabber sound Plus app the earpads are equal parts serious and classic crafted in rather high quality synthetic leather elegantly perforated by the brand jabber takes care to provide a small lightly padded carrying case and Elemental courtesy to at least protect against dust impacts charging is via a USBC connection and leg beats fairly recent solo Pro the connector has been released so there's no standby mode and no ability to use the headphones on a pure USBC connection the headset does not constrict the ears too much allowing them to breathe relatively well while properly adapting to different body types the swivel side of the shells allow you to leave some latitude for example for slightly protruding ears this low setting allows almost no pressure to be felt during long sessions and even those who wear glasses can use them comfortably on the remotes buttons on the right there is the on off pairing switch play pause button and volume buttons also used to change tracks like most other jobber products including true Wireless they are multi-point can connect to two transmitters simultaneously which is rare enough in this price range to pull off on top of that comes a five band graphic equalizer accompanied by a number of preset equalizers as well as the ability to edit your own settings in use it meets expectations stable connection with a very good range and very few errors or sound jumps due to its lack of A and C combined with more average measured power and basic codecs SBC only thumbs up that's for sure if you don't hesitate to spend a few extra bucks we're highlighting the powers and Wilkins px7s2 the best premium headphones in 2023 with tons of new features and Hardware updates it has great potential to compete with other Premium Bluetooth headphones on the surface the design looks solid and appealing with a pleasant mix of smooth and stitched textures providing uniformity the construction is durable with evenly placed buttons and smooth turns underneath all of it are the Bowers and Wilkins custom 40 millimeter drivers constructed with low Distortion biocellulose diaphragms and a wireless platform capable of 24-bit low latency transmission for exceptional Clarity it also has six built-in microphones to monitor the outside environment plus adaptive noise cancellation settings that can be controlled through the Bowers and Wilkins app the battery life of the px7s2 is impressive with up to 30 hours of Maximum battery life upon a two hour charge or 7 hours of battery life when charged for just 15 minutes and its sound stages wide and close it offers good surround sound as well as an immersive experience even with ANC mode on delivering high quality detail at all times although they are more expensive than other headphones on the market they're worth it if you want a hassle-free listening experience with excellent Fidelity and Clarity if you can afford this Beast we say go for it finally we present to you the best overall headphones available on the market in 2023 Sony has always been top-notch when it comes to its Flagship ANC headphones the xm5s are a significant departure from Sony's typical design language for the wh-1000xm series they have this new shape that looks pretty minimal crisp and clean compared to the xm4 they have a thinner more rounded headband the headphones are also more minimalistic and very comfortable they lean more towards the design of the Bose 700 and airpods Max which isn't necessarily a bad thing first notice how light they are when you pick them up weighing in at 250 grams the xm5s are lightweight and Incredibly comfortable to wear in the head discreet memory foam ear cups are contoured to the shape of the head and fit comfortably around the ears the Earth sensor stops the music when you take off the headphones they automatically turn off to save battery power if they've been off for a while there is also an option to let ambient noise pass by placing your hand over the right ear cup despite active noise cancellation being the main feature the vh1000xm5 has some really cool smart features that further enhance the listening experience let's start with the location knowledge the headphones can learn your daily routine and Ambient sound control settings can be adjusted based on your location when paired with the smartphone when headphones detect that you're at home they can reduce the noise cancellation compared to when you're at the office if you go for a walk it can play more outside sound to keep you safe when crossing the street another great smart feature is speak to chat as the name suggests if you start a conversation while listening to the headphones you can talk without taking them off furthermore you can connect to two devices simultaneously and switch between them depending on what's happening on each for example to prioritize a notification finally there is better support for voice assistance Alexa and Google Assistant can be activated hands-free using the appropriate activation commands Sony has increased the number of microphones on the xm5 from 4 to 8 as for the sound it's rich and Lively sound profile emphasizes both high and low frequencies resulting in truly beautiful sound that is a pleasure to listen to even the subtlest nuances are easily heard thanks to the rich detail and the treble the lower frequencies sound tight and Punchy without being overdone or muddy overall this model delivers premium performance at the best possible price quality ratio you wanted the best you got it so that's it for the top 5 best headphones in 2023 like comment and subscribe to receive the notifications

(In-Depth)\", \"link\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0tGO9RIjjg\", \"video_id\": \"W0tGO9RIjjg\", \"transcript\": \"thank you welcome to the ovary headphones Awards where for the past few months I've been doing some in-depth testing on as many different pairs as I could to narrow down a list of the best wireless headphones you can buy of course everyone has different priorities when it comes to headphones and the term best can vary depending on what you want from your headphones for some that's the noise canceling performance for others is the call Quality or comfort and for many it's simply the sound quality so I tested each of them against each other in a series of tests to determine the winners in each of these categories before finally narrowing down a top seven so as we go through the video I'll give you a review of each of these headphones highlighting the areas they perform well and not so well in I'll show you the final rankings at the end so we can see the winners in each category and from this we can determine the overall performance of each one which will not only give us our ultimate winner but should also help you to see which of these headphones best suits your particular needs there's obviously a lot to cover here and it's taken weeks of testing to get to this point so without further Ado let's take a look at the headphones awards for 2023 we'll start things off with the new Bose quiet Comfort SE which is essentially exactly the same as the qc45s the only differences are a sled color change and a redesigned carry case this is actually the only soft carry case in this video the essay even appears as the 45s when you connect to the app just in case there was any doubt that the two models are the same interestingly Bose confirmed to me that the SC isn't a replacement for the 45s and is to launch alongside them instead confusingly at a lower price point right now for those wondering about the Bose nc700 they were a contender but with the SE having Superior battery life noise canceling sound quality and comfort these were the better choice with the SE the build quality and basic design aren't as premium or aesthetically pleasing as some of her other entries the button controls are a little mushy and bunch closely together there's no wearing detection and these use the less common two and a half millimeter port for the aux cable but the clue isn't the name as to why these make this list Bose's quiet Comfort headphones are both fantastic and noise canceling and super comfortable to wear for long periods of time these are the lightest pair of headphones in this entire video and pairing this with spacious earcups and an ultra low clamping Force these are one of the best pairs you can buy for long listening sessions with this design the relatively thin headband and ear cup padding is actually plenty and has the added benefit of not causing your ears to warm up too much but surprisingly these take second place for comfort and we'll see which entry beats these later so that's the Comfort aspect and as for the quiet part well these have amazing noise canceling performance and beat all of the other competitors for ANC simply put these are the strongest noise canceling headphones you can buy right now so with a foldable design in excellent Comfort these are one of the best options you can get for traveling especially long-haul flights so that alone is enough to make lots of people buy these but let's take a look at where these didn't perform so well firstly the my quality was one of the poorest here he's letting quite a lot of the background noise and my voice wasn't especially clear those do have the useful self-voice feature so you can adjust how much of your own voice you want to hear on a call it's in a noisy environment these headphones struggle to isolate your voice 's companion app is super clean but also fairly limited for instance despite being the most powerful you can't adjust the level of noise cancellation incidentally customization was the main area I found the nc700 to be better but here it's either full ANC or in transparency mode which by the way isn't anywhere near as good as the ANC possibly as a result of not being able to switch these to off mode the battery life is the poorest in this video at just 24 hours there's also no Google Fast pair or high-end codecs it's SBC or AAC only but like every entry in this video These do offer multi-points so you can connect to two devices at the same time and switch over by pausing on one and playing on the other with the sound quality this was one of the easier aspects to rank because although the sound quality is good here these are a noticeable step down in quality compared to the others Bose has quite a unique sound signature where the mids and vocals are pushed forward and the bass is quite tame it's a tuning that could be great for podcasts and is unlikely to fatigue your ears but the clarity and instrument separation is lacking and increasing the volume to compensate for the lack of bass the high-end frequencies can become harsh Bose's basic equalizer only lets you offset this slightly and I think overall with the lack of any high-end codecs these are one of the weaker performers when it comes to sound quality casual listeners will find these okay but audio files should stay clear so that fantastic noise cancellation and comfort does come with some trade-offs but the price is not one of them because these are the cheapest entry in this video the new SE model aren't quite appearing on the US Bose site yet but the 45s are down to 249 and I've even seen this as low as 189 pounds in the UK okay the next entry is the master and dynamic mw75 this time we get a rather large hard shell carry case covered in felds which isn't my favorite design but does keep the headphones protected these are packed with accessories including nylon braided USB C2C and USB to three and a half millimeter cables a quarter inch adapter a USBC to a adapter and an airplane adapter all neatly stored inside the case immediately you notice the big step up in terms of build quality and design these are one of the three what I'd call Luxury models in this video they're made of anodized aluminum glass and lambskin leather so they're no good if you're avoiding animal products but the materials contribute to an undeniably premium aesthetic the overall construction feels really solid it's just a shame these don't fall down for easier transport button controls are tactile but a bit on the small side and again bunch too close together you can easily power these off by mistake when reaching for the ANC button we do at least have wearing detection here though it was a bit inconsistent with these they won't Auto resume if you leave them paused for any more than a few seconds interestingly the usb-c port serves as both the charging port and the connection for Wired listening there's no AUX port on the headphones at all the trade-off with this premium materials is weights and therefore Comforts these are the heaviest headphones in this list at 338 grams and you really feel it the clamping force is reasonable but I find the ear cups are too small you have to maneuver these back and forth until your rears finally fit inside and there's not much room to breathe either the relatively firm but thick padding does help and I can still comfortably wear these for a few hours but they're placed in seventh for Comfort overall the 75s don't boast much in terms of features the app is rather basic hosting a handful of preset equalizers but disappointingly no custom EQ toggles for the audio prompt wearing detection feature and the auto power off and some options for the ANC mode but that's essentially it so it's not an app you really need to revisit in terms of the actual noise canceling performance these are just about on the right side of average the same as with the transparency mode and the rankings reflect this too ANC suddenly helps in a noisy environment but these don't perform to the level one might hope the headphones or the price tag this large attached plus these come with a quiet hiss with ANC turned on you at least get some more options here such as adaptive mode and you can turn off ANC to save on battery too you get 28 hours of listening with ANC so that's just above bows and puts these in sixth place one surprisingly good aspect is the cool quality these do a really decent job even in noisy environments and isolate my voice well on phone calls good enough to award these third plays for the microphone quality there's no Google Fast pair again but we do have much better codec choices with support for aptx adaptive which of course means higher quality streaming too these also offer multi-points and Bluetooth 5.1 but otherwise things are catch pretty simple second only to the design in terms of strengths is the sound quality with the mw75s we're entering the audiophile territory with an impressively wide Sound Stage bright treble but a fairly neutral overall presentation the step up and quality from Bose is immediately apparent with a far richer and more expansive and detailed sound the base here brings so much more body to your music which just starts to Boom ever so slightly especially at higher volumes and can encroach on the mids that's really the main quality that keeps these away from the top spot still these sound excellent over Bluetooth and you can even unlock 24 bit 96 kilohertz audio with wired listening through USBC but with sound quality or rather sound preference being so subjective the lack of a custom equalizer does let these down these can also reach pretty high volume levels but those smaller cups don't give the tightest acoustic seal to minimize sound leakage for which these ranked only six M D's mw75 are a stylish premium level pair of headphones with awesome sound that are surprisingly good for phone calls there are four stunning color options to choose from but that design is really going to have to pull most of the weight in justifying the high price tag these retail for 599 or 549 pounds next up is Apple's airpods Max just kidding these are overpriced uncomfortable and with so many of the best features being exclusive to iOS they're only a top 7 pair for Apple users next up is actually sennheiser's momentum 4. these come with a hard shell carry case these is a tough fabric exterior a design will see similar variations of later as well elastic straps hold down the USB a to c charging cable a two and a half to three and a half millimeter right angled alt cable so these also use the smaller two and a half millimeter ports an airplane adapter and there's a mesh pouch inside too with the paperwork the momentum 4S are unique in the use of fabric on the headband which looks and feels great and is paired with an otherwise quite simple design with a matte black plastic ear cups the design is something these get criticized for because of the move towards a more modern but generic style compared to the momentum threes that no longer folds down however I personally prefer that these don't use real leather I actually think they look much better now and the new lighter design greatly improves Comfort these use large deep and thick padded ear cups and although the headband padding is much thinner they didn't really cause any soreness there the only potential Comfort issue is the clamping Force which isn't bad necessarily but these are the tightest feeling headphones in this video and consequently there's only scored fifth place for comfort something I quite like though is that the ear cups rotate flat in both directions which is really useful whether you want to hang these around your neck or set them down on your desk you'll find only one physical button here which is used for power Bluetooth pairing battery info and summoning your voice assistant otherwise we have perhaps the most responsive and intuitive touch control system in this video we get all of the regulars for volume and skipping tracks but also extras like pinching to adjust the level of ANC or transparency the wearing detection is also super responsive and can even automatically power on the headphones when you put them on and place calls on hold when you take them off the any control downsides are one no hands-free voice assistant and two the multi-point isn't the most efficient or reliable if you don't pause on the first device before trying to play on the other your music will just play Into The Ether possibly without you knowing sometimes when these couldn't find the second device they would repeatedly interrupt to let me know this with a voice prompt and I did sometimes have connection issues when using two devices at once so there is multi-point but it wasn't the most seamless experience sennheiser's companion app is really good the interface looks great and you're offered good customization over the sound including custom and even personalized equalizers control over the ANC and transparency level including adaptive and wind noise reduction modes and you can even set location-based profiles with custom ANC and sound settings the noise canceling and transparency are the weakest aspects of these headphones the momentum 4 was ranked in seven for both neither is bad and in the real world you'll find both will serve you well in everyday situations but there's quite a substantial gap between these and the likes of Sony and Bose that's worth considering if noise canceling is one of your priorities the same can be said for the call Quality too which was pretty good but there are certainly better options and there's any rate in fifth my voice was usually intelligible on calls even in noisy environments and these have the useful side tone feature so you can adjust how much of your own voice is heard but I find this letting quite a lot of the background noise which can make you harder to hear these are for Bluetooth 5.2 a great codex selection including aptex adaptive and can even play audio via USBC the standout feature is the battery life as these offer a huge 60 hours and that's with ANC turned on this dwarves the competition and comfortably Awards Sennheiser first place for battery life another major strength unsurprisingly is the sound quality these right in third here but the competition for second place was extremely close and will largely come down to your personal preference there was a much bigger Step Up in quality with our sound quality winners but as one of our cheaper entries I'd also say that the momentum Falls offer the best sound quality to price ratio sennheiser's signature open rich and crisp sound is suitable for all genres and volumes we're not quite at audiophile levels in terms of neutrality to my ears there's a slight v-shape boosting the bass and treble but not to the typical overemphasized levels we're used to the separation remains clear and distinct and these are for a well detailed and refined sound this creates a sound signature that I expect will greatly appeal to the masses so even if you don't delve into The Equalizer settings to fine-tune these you'll likely really enjoy the out of the box experience you can crank up the volume and bass if you choose and the plush padding and firm clamping Force keep the sound leakage relatively low which may be useful to know for those looking to not disturb others around them the momentum fours don't offer the most premium design or the best noise canceling performance but they do have a fantastic control scheme amazing battery life and the best sound quality you can get without extending Beyond a 400 price tag they're available for 349 or 299 pounds just before we go on I want to quickly tell you about today's sponsor nordvpn you guys know what a VPN is and I've personally used a bunch of them before but have been particularly impressed with how seamless the Nord experience has been just one tab I'm connected actually that's not true because I use the auto connect feature so I don't even have to do anything I'm essentially just using the internet exactly as I normally would except now I have the benefits of online privacy and security my real IP address and location are hidden I have threat protection from trackers and malware and I can bypass geo-restricted content no matter where I'm traveling I'm currently using it across all of my devices and I just like that one it's actually fast so I get those benefits without a drop in connection speed and two the app interface is great that's something I'm especially enjoying with Nord at the moment so if you want secure and private access to the internet then I'd highly recommend nordvpn they've been kind enough to give me a discount code to offer you guys as well so I'll leave that down in the video description and as a pinned comment now for the entry that's probably the least expected and least well known in Technics eah 800 those of you who watch the earbuds Awards this year know that the Technics earbuds also scored very well you get a leatherette style hard shell case here along with a USB a to c charging cable a right angled aux cable and an airplane adapter now these are the headphones with the least exciting design they don't really use premium materials and the build quality isn't amazing but they score surprisingly well in lots of other categories immediately one redeeming feature is the folding design for easy travel which seems to be becoming less common now they use a hybrid of both physical buttons for the majority of the controls and a very sensitive touchpad which is more limited in its function and reserved just for some ANC and phone call Related controls the buttons are a bit too close together for my liking but overall the controls are fine there's also wearing detection though it can be a little slow but we do get hands-free Alexa integration though sadly not the Google Assistant Comfort is excellent with these and they tick pretty much every Box large spacious ear cups thick padding for the ear cups and headband and a very low clamping Force make these comfortable to wear for hours at a time these aren't the lightest headphones in this video but that's essentially the only reason these place in third for comfort the Technics app experience is simple enough provided you stick to the main two tabs where you'll find lots of customization over the ANC and transparency level and also the sound quality including custom and preset equalizers the settings tab can be a bit overwhelming with a long list of features and settings to customize so there are lots of ways to personalize these headphones but actually most of these settings you can set once and then just ignore connectivity is a major strength we have Bluetooth 5.2 Google Fast pair for quick setup on Android and location tracking and the SBC AAC and ldac codecs so no app text here but there are arguments as to whether ldac the technically higher quality codec is preferred over aptx adaptive the more flexible stable and less power hungry option the best feature though is the multi-point because not all multi-point is created equally you don't need to pause on the first device before switching over you can simply Tap Play on the other device and the sound immediately switches over automatically causing the audio on the first device for you it's extremely satisfying to use and even reconnecting to both devices after powering on the headphones is very fast it's multi-point done right you can also use ldac and multi-point at the same time I mentioned that since it's often the case that they're mutually exclusive battery life here is also excellent at 50 hours with ANC turned on so these are the only other pair that even come close to Sennheiser and there's quite a gap between these and a third placed entry another strong point is the mic quality these are quite an aggressive cancellation of the background noise a setting you can actually increase in the app which works very well in noisy environments but can sometimes clip or buffer your voice generally though these are a great option for phone calls and secured second place for my quality strong mic performance is usually a good indicator for ANC performance and the noise cancellation was indeed really good these do a really good job of blocking out the outside noise and also naturally amplifying it with transparency mode there's great customization over how strong each of these are as well and I like that you can cycle between all three modes with the touch pads my only complaint is that the initial setup for ANC is confusing and it's not clear how exactly it's changing the performance it's not intuitive that the ANC sounded best here these ranked in third overall for both categories but I do feel like there's a noticeable step up with our first and second place entries especially for ANC after a great showing in the sound quality category for Technics earbuds earlier this year I was optimistic about the headphones performance too but the competition is stronger here and sixth place is no mean fees these sound noticeably better than our seventh place bows anyway the a800s offer the most distinct v-shaped EQ of the seven which makes for a consumer-friendly sound profile that will sound good to most people Straight Out of the Box audiophiles may be moaned the slightly booming bass that lacks the control of our higher placed entries and the boosted vocals and treble to compensate for this but it makes for a dynamic energetic and well detailed sound and you can really crank up the volume with these two the clarity is good here we can't quite match sennheiser's cleaner mid-range nor the depth and separation of the mw75 so as great as these sound I think they fall just shy of the audiophile classification these also scored well in the sound leakage test and would make a good choice for keeping your music to yourself the a800s retail for 349 or 299 pounds and whilst their main lack a premium design or a killer feature set to instantly draw you in they offer an undeniably strong overall performance with six second or third place finishes techniques go toe-to-toe with the big names and are well worth considering we'll move on now to the bows and Wilkins px8 these come in one of those tough fabric exterior hard shell cases but have a cool magnetic compartment inside to hold the USBC to C and USB to three and a half millimeter cables like M D's mw75 these are another of the luxury models and the build quality here is simply outstanding from the stitching on the Napa leather to the cast aluminum arms these look and feel extremely high quality the extension on the headband and the rotation of the earcups is satisfyingly smooth and there's some resistance here too which adds to the premium aesthetic so although a non-vegan option is take a clear first place for build quality and look fantastic too these don't fold down for easier travel sadly but like sennheiser's headphones the ear cups rotate flat in both directions those materials do contribute to a relatively High weight though and with a reasonably firm clamping Force they're not as comfortable for longer listening sessions as some of the lighter models fortunately the ear cups are large and spacious and the padding on both the headband and ear cups is very thick and plush so I can still wear these comfortably for hours the px8s are a great example of physical buttons done right they're large and tactile and actually easy to distinguish thanks to the ridge center button they feel great to press these do come with wearing detection although it was a little bit slow even when you set the sensitivity to be high you don't get much in terms of customization either the left side button can either be the ANC mode or The Voice Assistant it seems strange to me that BMW don't even offer a double press option for something else surely that could easily be added through an update these do offer multi-point though and I'm pleased to say that it works like Technics does so pressing play on the other device immediately switches over the audio Source it's awesome connectivity in general was a mixed bag we get Bluetooth 5.2 and great codec choices including aptex adaptive but there's no Google Fast pair and for some strange reason I couldn't get the audio working via USBC there's no AUX port on the headphones so this is actually the only wired option I'm waiting to hear back from BMW about this since there are others reporting this too but for now these don't seem to offer a wired listening option so that's potentially an issue if these run out of battery life which incidentally will happen after 30 hours of playback so that's pretty much on par with the industry standard the overall feature set here is very light you can see in the app there's not much beyond the ANC mode a very basic equalizer for just the bass and treble and a couple of toggles for wearing detection and the auto power off the noise cancellation overall was one of the weaker aspects a step up from Sennheiser and still fairly good but lacking behind the performance of Sony and Bows they definitely take out a lot of the low end frequencies but have little effect on the others beyond what they passively block out In fairness this is a good amount thanks to the Great Seal the ear cups form around your ears and this helps to keep the sound leakage very low as well interestingly the transparency mode was actually great it's Amplified with a bit of a hiss but does make your surroundings really clear after testing the ANC I wasn't too surprised to find that the mic quality also isn't great with these my voice was oddly quiet and slightly muffled so even though these do fairly well with isolating my voice in a noisy environment it can still be hard to hear for the caller so these take sixth place as former winners of the best sounding true wireless earbuds it's no surprise that BMW's over here headphones offer similarly great sound quality performance is offer an open and beautifully refined sound with an expansive Sound Stage the level of clarity and instrument separation in the mid-range in particular is extraordinary for a wireless pair of headphones there's a lot of depth and control over the bass although I'd say the treble isn't quite as crisp as what Sennheiser or M D are offering so I'd personally add a touch of treble to the default War Machine the lack of even a 5 band EQ may put off those who really like to fine-tune their headphones the px8s offer a wonderfully rich and precise audiophile pleasing sound There's A step above the vast majority of competitors I've only heard one pair that can actually beat these BMW's px8 have a clear focus on build quality design and the sound quality so these factors obviously rank at the top for many people and could justify the relatively very high price tag at 699 or 599 pounds others may be looking for a more well-rounded or customizable option but if you're looking for a classy pair with fantastic sound quality that's exactly what you get here the penultimate entry is the bang Olufsen h95 and before we get into it I know some of you will be wondering whether cheaper Ajax model weren't included instead the h95s are insanely expensive and it might appear that the HX model are the more appropriate to compare against the others but the truth is that in testing the 95s overall performed better and more importantly what the HX are good at the h95 take to the next level so the HX end up being still incredibly expensive but also not as good as the 95s they're awkwardly Stuck in the Middle it just felt to me that you're paying this much money for a reason and you can justify that for the 95s but not really the HX so that's why they've made the cards first of all just check out this insane aluminum carry case for the headphones and inside the nylon braided leather strapped USBC charging cable aux cable airplane adapter and even a microfiber cloth you open this case and everything just screams premium quality I mean these even smell good so the overall package is second to none in terms of luxury again we have smooth adjustments of the headband and reassuring resistance when rotating the earcups though not quite as smooth as with the px8 which just snatched the win for the overall build quality the 95s could have easily taken the top spot though with their titanium Fabric and genuine leather Construction again these are one to avoid for the animal lovers but the premium build an aesthetic are on a level you can only expect with such a high price tag these are one of the few especially luxury models that actually fold down one of the benefits over the HX though I can't say these are super travel friendly with that metal case which is just begging to be scratched the weakest aspect of these headphones is the comforts you don't get the largest ear cups here they're quite heavy and the padding is a bit on the thin side the clamping force is reasonably firm though not too tight and despite the materials used the weight is actually kept fairly low so those aren't really the issue it's more the soreness of the crown of your head which I find Creeps in after a few hours of listening what's most interesting about the design is the control scheme because we have a rotating dial on both earcups one side for the volume and the other for the ANC level select the Microsoft Surface headphones this gives you instant intuitive control over these and it works really well my only gripe is that they're kind of loose and they also turn infinitely rather than stopping at the extremes there is a gentle beep when you reach full ANC or transparency and the same with the volume extremes but I think some tactile or better audible feedback as you move over each increment would make this much more satisfying or better still to physically feel some resistance here would have been great and it just doesn't feel like the dials keeper but the otherwise Ultra Premium feel we also have a metal switch for the power and Bluetooth pairing a single button on the left for the voice assistant and the right ear cup has a touchpad for the usual play pause and skipping tracks it's responsive and works well one disappointment though there's no wearing detection feature wise the experience is pretty Bare Bones in the app you'll find a slider for the ANC level toggles for the Adaptive mode Windows reduction and the autopower feature and there are also some preset eqs and a custom mode which is very easy to use especially for those unfamiliar with equalizers but for headphones aimed at audio files I would have hoped for a bit more precise control over the sound the noise canceling and transparency here is fairly good but these are really only a middle of the pack performer and again there's quite a step up for the market leaders normally this wouldn't be so much of an issue but since these are so expensive one would hope for better performance like the others in this list they're still going to block out enough sound in most situations you'll find yourself in but don't expect great ANC or transparency here on the plus side the passive noise isolation is quite good thanks to a good seal forward with the ear cups and these actually offer the least sound leakage from any of the finalists in keeping with our theme of average ANC suggests average mic quality these were okay for phone calls they're not great they do a fairly good job of rejecting background noise which places them above Sennheiser in fourth for my quality the Revelation course still wasn't super loud or clear so these aren't great in noisy environments especially connectivity is interesting because we get Bluetooth 5.1 a good codex selection including aptx adaptive and support for both Google Fast pair and Microsoft Swift pair these also have multi-point sadly not the Super far switching multi-points you still have to pause on the first device beforehand and actually I did have some stuttering issues at first when switching over so that's an overall pretty good mix but sadly these don't play audio via USBC and even worse they don't work passively with the cable when the headphones are switched off so wired listening isn't an option for when the battery runs out these are the only headphones here for giving the px8s for now that aren't able to do this fortunately the battery life is really good you get 38 hours with ANC turned on which ranks these in third place but then we get to sound quality where these are really in A League of Their Own there were some comparisons that were very close to cool like Sennheiser vs m d but with the h95 it just felt like nothing else could match the clarity and precision over the sound what sets these apart from the rest and I do think these open up a sound quality gap over the others is how wide The Sound Stage is and how clear the instrument separation is listening with these I was hearing details and drags I'd never heard before and to me this feels like the most accurate representation of the original sound from any pair of bluetooth headphones I've tested the base here is so natural and well controlled in fact it might even seem underwhelming to an average consumer since the majority of headphones are bass boosted the only other potential drawback to mention is that these don't get super loud like most of the others either but there's no muddying of the other frequencies and when balanced with an open and clear mid-range and crisp treble this is a sound that true audio files will appreciate and this is what I mean about justifying the price of the h95s not everyone has nine hundred dollars to spend on Bluetooth headphones but if you want the very best sound quality then you can justify getting these so that let's face it ridiculous price tag is going to immediately alienate the majority of people and that's totally understandable especially when features like the mic quality and the noise cancellation don't justify it but there's a very clear Market which these headphones are aimed at and it's those looking for a luxury package and class leading sound quality and our final entry is for sure going to be the least surprising of all which is Sony's wh-1000x M5 and I have to hand it to Sony there are a lot of great things about these headphones I'll start with actually the packaging Sony is the only company bothering to use sustainable materials for the packaging tech companies it literally doesn't matter what the packaging looks like but choices like this really benefit the environment so well done Sony the charging case is another of those tough fabric exterior ones and inside like the px8 case there's a magnetic compartment for the accessories a USB AC charging cable and a right angled aux cable let's start with arguably the weakest aspect which is the design and build quality it seems strange calling this a weak aspect because actually it's still really good here it's just that we're dealing with the very best headphones on the market so the lack of Premium materials here places Sony in fifth for build quality the minimal matte black design is similar to previous iterations from Sony the big change this year is a shift towards a non-folding design with earcups that only rotate away from you so you trade some travel convenience for structural integrity I think the single most surprising result from the entire testing period was Sony's first place for Comfort I mentioned that one pair somehow beat Bose's quiet Comfort headphones and it turned out to be the mark fives these are super lightweight at 250 grams they have the biggest and most spacious ear cups of all and an ultra low clamping Force so they took every box the padding is actually reasonably thin but you simply don't need it to be any thicker with these and actually this helps with keeping ear warming to a minimum the only downside is that without a very tight seal there is a bit more sound leakage than most of the others but what you gain in Comfort is totally worth it and I can happily wear these for hours on end the controls we have two buttons on the left for power battery and Bluetooth pairing and the other for changing the ANC mode on the right ear cup there's a touchpad to the music controls which are all very responsive my personal favorite is quick attention where you can cover the right ear cup to temporarily lower the music volume and turn on transparency mode which is so useful if you only need to quickly hear your surroundings I don't know if Sony has patented this but it's mad that no one else seems to be doing it too these also offer speak to chats a similar but hands-free feature for automatic transparency which you can customize in the app there's also hands-free hey Google and Alexa integration built-in Spotify tab wiring detection multi-point it's clear the mark files take a deserved first place for the controls as well for connectivity we have Bluetooth 5.2 Google Fast pair and Microsoft Swift pair and the SBC AAC and ldot codecs so that's all good except that multi-point and Dell DAC can't be used at the same time which is why I made the point that you can do this with the Technics headphones you can keep listening passively by the aux cable when these run out of battery and these offer 30 hours of playback with ANC turned on so that's pretty much the industry standard now but only Awards only fifth place for battery it will likely come as no surprise to tell you to the mark 5's noise cancellation is fantastic somehow a step up from the also great Mark IVs and these block out a huge amount of external noise with no hissing sound either I mentioned the low clamping force and the lack of a super Tight Seal so this goes to show just how much work the ANC is doing these don't have to rely on passive noise isolation and can still be extremely comfortable whilst offering excellent ANC this only just beaten by Bose these two really are in A League of Their Own though when it comes to noise cancellation it's superb although Beau is a slightly more powerful at blocking out noise Sony's ANC is more advanced and has some advantages I mentioned quick attention and speak to chat already but there's also features like adaptive sound control which gives you automatic switching of custom ANC profiles based on either your movement or location Sony has been doing this for a while now and the feature is pretty well optimized the mark files have automatic NC optimization for the environment too including for air pressure changes so combined with the best Comfort there's actually no better pair for a long-haul flight or really any kind of travel one of the things I noticed when compared to Bose is the lack of the cabin pressure-like sensation when using ANC I feel it slightly with Bose's se but not at all with Sony's Mark 5S and finally the simple fact that I can easily turn Ambient sound off with these is a huge plus Bose forces you to use either ANC or transparency which drains the battery even if you don't need it so overall Sony could easily have taken the ANC award instead I should also mention that the transparency mode is excellent the best in this video there is a tiny hiss so it isn't perfect but you do get the clearest amplification of your surroundings with these and you're able to adjust the transparency level in the app based on that ANC and transparency performance it came as no surprise that the mark 5's my quality was excellent but what did surprise me was how much better it was than the mark IVs and the rest of the competition these take first place by a big margin no other headphones can compete with the volume and Clarity of my voice and it could even use these for calls in noisy environments I think the main aspect letting these headphones down is the sound quality Sony still has a warm bass focused sound signature that's lacking the detail precision and accuracy of the market leaders the bass is actually Tighter and more controlled than the previous Mark IVs this is the best sound Sony has offered and there's more control than say Technics headphones there's a lot of depth and volume with the sound too loads of customization with the mini preset or custom equalizers and even an albeit limited spatial audio feature but there's still an emphasis on the low end and the rolled off treble though Pleasant sounding and free from any harsh sibilance is lacking that sharpness and detail that would balance out the sound again it seems strange talking about sound quality as a sort of weakness because if you're not an audio file then any one of these with the exception of Bose perhaps is going to sound really good of all the hundreds of ANC headphones on the market these still sound comparatively fantastic and lots of people actually like Sony's base Focus tuning but an audio file listening to these and then switching to the px8s or the h95s will instantly notice that step up and quality in particular with regards to balance and clarity Sony's wh-1000xm5 are clearly an extremely well-rounded pair of headphones with a great feature set 349 or 299 pounds they undercut those premium Alternatives that offer Superior sound quality but also beaten for Comfort controls and the ANC and mic performance they're certainly an attractive all-rounder and comfortably make it into this year's headphones Awards okay so we covered a lot of information there but let's break down what all of it means first of all here are the final rankings for all seven pairs of headphones you can immediately pick out the strengths and weaknesses for each one you may notice now that the order I review them in was from worst to best according to their overall performance bows in 7th and Sony in first Sony not only scored the best all-round performance but also the highest number of wins with four statistically it is by far the overall winner and the best pair of bluetooth headphones you can buy right now but everyone has their own specific factors that they prioritize for instance if you want the best sounding headphones then Sony may be no good and the same if you want one of the more luxury models with a premium build quality so you may be looking more towards bno or bows and Wilkins but you should factor in that there's a comfort versus luxury trade-off the top three most comfortable pairs were actually 5th 6th and seventh in build quality but even if there was an objective winner that doesn't mean that it's your winner equally seventh doesn't mean bad it just means not as good as the other six in some cases only very slightly Bose's SE scored the most Seventh Place finishes for instance but if your priorities and noise canceling and comfort then they may be your winner anyway most of us will have to take price into consideration too and actually if you look at the cost adjusted table you'll see changes like the h95s drop from second into sixth and Bose move up from Seventh into fourth once again though Sony's m5s are still the overall winner after factoring in the price and to throw my two cents in I would pick Sony's m5s on a personal level as well they still sound good enough for me and if I really wanted true audiophile level sound quality then I wouldn't be looking at Bluetooth headphones they would be my recommendation to most people and hopefully you can now see why in fact they're so good that even the previous mark IV share most of the same great features you should be able to find those now at an even cheaper price obviously I couldn't go into Super in-depth detail on each model here so as to keep the video concise at ham over 30 minutes but hopefully this breakdown has been helpful and if so

\"video_id\": \"n-6qk7EGLlE\", \"transcript\": \"while true wireless earbuds have dominated the headphones landscape the last few years there are plenty of people who still like the full size variety and that's why I put together this Roundup of the best wireless noise canceling over-ear headphones of 2022. that'll be clear these are headphones that were released in 2022 and I haven't included any models that came out in years past I've narrowed it down to my five favorites with an additional affordable pick thrown in because when you get into these top wireless headphones well they tend to be rather expensive and a lot of people just can't afford them but we're talking about the best of the best so here we go here are my picks from highest to lowest price [Music] at 799 we have the focal bathies focal is a French Audio company known for its high-end speakers and wired headphones some of which cost thousands of dollars it's finally done with a lot of high-end audio companies have had to do in this age of on-the-go Wireless music listening make active noise canceling Bluetooth headphones but they also have a built-in DAC that stands for digital to analog converter for USB wirelessening with any computer smartphone or tablet with USBC and that makes it easy to go from Wireless to wirelessening for slightly better sound the bathys build quality and design are excellent they're comfortable to wear and they're easily one of the best sounding wireless headphones they offer excellent Clarity detail accuracy and Powerful well-defined bass that's got the right amount of warp to it they have a spacious Sound Stage for closed back headphones anyway and they allow you to hear each instrument distinctly in complicated tracks where several instruments are playing at the same time the bathies use aluminum magnesium speaker drivers while focals higher end wired headphones have beryllium drivers that offer even more clarity and accuracy with the right setup their noise canceling isn't as strong or as good as what you get with the Sony wh-1000 Xbox 5 or the Bose quiet Comfort 45 headphones for example but focal has done its best to implement noise canceling without sacrificing sound quality which is always a challenge they're also good for making calls so a really great headphone overall but out of most people's price range though it is cheaper than the mark Levinson number 5909 headphones that go for around a thousand bucks okay moving on to the Bowers and Wilkins px8 at 699 when they originally announced the Swanky px8 were supposed to cost 549 for essentially the same price as Apple's airpods max headphones however when they finally hit stores the px8s price jumped to 6.99 or a full 300 more than the company stepped down px7 Series 2 headphones which are also excellent the biggest difference between the px8 and the px7 S2 are the px8s all new 40 millimeter carbon cone drive units that are inspired by the carbon Dome drive units used in the company's 700 series loudspeaker line Bowers and Wilkins says these units help deliver Superior resolution detail and timing with even more accurate sound than the px7s II based on my test that's true I like the px7s2 the px8 headphones do sound more special with the touch more openness and overall Clarity the right near the top for sound in a Bluetooth headphone and are also comfortable to wear for long listening sessions for the best sound you can listen to lossless files on a computer in wired mode with a USBC to USBC cable as for the noise canceling function it's good but not quite on par with what you get with the Sony wh-1000x Mark V and while the voice calling capabilities are solid these don't reduce background noise quite as well as some headphones like the Sony when you're on calls however the transparency mode is Top Notch while I can't say they're worth 300 more than the px7 S2 they're a great set of cans if you can afford them I do prefer the sound and overall performance with a more expensive focal bathies that the bathies don't have such strong noise canceling but the px8 are a close second at 5.99 we have the master of dynamic mw75 headphones the company's best headphones to date a last metal construction adds weight but that's a trade-off some people don't mind the mw75 sound excellent with clean accurate sound natural sounding mids and nice treble detail the base is tight and Punchy with just enough warmth the mw75 seem well suited for all types of music genres and I had no trouble wearing the headphones for longer listening sessions though I would have liked the ear pads to be slightly larger I thought they measured up well against the Apple airpods Max for sound quality the mw75 came across as the more accurate natural sounding headphones the airpods max had a little more energy and played a little louder but the mw75 sounded a bit smoother and a tad more articulate it's also worth noting that while the mw75 don't have quite the noise canceling capabilities of the Sony wh-1000x Mark V they do offer very good noise canceling and are also very good for making calls another great headphone overall speaking of the Sony that's the next headphone on this list it's 400 though it's been discounted lately to around 350 this is the headphone that's going to hit the sweet spot for a lot of people it's relatively lightweight and comfortable sounds really good and offers top-notch noise canceling and noise reduction during voice calls Some people prefer the dual hinge design at the earlier 1000x mark IV which offers a little more bass energy but I personally prefer the slightly more refined sound of the Mark V and particularly appreciated the improvements to the call Quality well the Sony doesn't sound quite as good as the models I've already talked about it does have some nice extra features like Sony speak to chat mode and it does cost less and has Best in Class noise canceling at number five I have sennheiser's momentum for wireless a 350 headphone that's been selling for closer to 300 while some people may be a little disappointed that their design has become a bit too straightforward and less distinctive with less premium materials than the previous momentum three they essentially check all the boxes for what you want in a premium noise canceling headphone from the standpoint of comfort features and performance initially I wasn't wowed by them but after I broke them in for a few days their sound grew on me and Sennheiser has improved not only their noise canceling performance but also their voice calling performance and unlike the previous momentum 3 they do fold flat and have incredible battery life at up to 60 hours depending on what I was listening to there were times when I thought they did sound slightly better than the Sony's they're just a tad more natural and accurate sounding and they do cost less than the Sony so that's another reason to consider them last but not least I have my value pick the sound core by anchor space Q45 which is currently selling for around 130 if you can afford Sony's 1000x Mark V or the similarly named Bose qc45 yes there's a bit of copying going on here the space Q45 is a good alternative it's comfortable to wear with nicely padded ear cups and a dual hinge folding design sound quality is very good and the headphones offer better noise canceling than the step down Q35 as well as multi-point Bluetooth pairing and they do support the ldac audio codec for streaming high resolution music tracks over Bluetooth if you have a device that supports ldac many Android phones do although Samsung's Galaxy phones don't battery life is also very good at up to 50 hours with noise canceling on to be clear this headphone isn't up to level of the other headphones in this Roundup but it's Anchor's best sounding noise canceling headphone to date and a good value relatively speaking so that's it those are my top over ear wireless headphones of 2022 if

Learn more. If you\\u2019re looking for the best headphones on the market, it\\u2019s tough to get a straight answer. What works for some people doesn\\u2019t work for others, and few product categories are as diverse as headphones. In-ears, on-ears, over-ears\\u2014there\\u2019s just so much to choose from, and it\\u2019s hard to tell what\\u2019s right for you. Editor\\u2019s note: This list was updated on March 10, 2023 to include the Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless as a top pick, and the Beyerdynamic DT 900 PRO X, Google Pixel Buds A-Series, Grado SR80x, Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, Sennheiser HD 660S2, and Shure SE215 in the Notable mentions, add isolation and frequency response charts for the AKG K371, and to update formatting. For our top five picks, you can find the isolation and frequency response charts at the end of each image gallery. You can learn more about how to read our charts here. Now that Sony has released the Sony WH-1000XM5, it takes the crown as the best active noise cancelling (ANC) headphones. This new model outperforms its closest competitors in noise attenuation and microphone quality. The default frequency response is a bit bassier than what we typically recommend, but you can easily equalize this from the Sony Headphones Connect app (iOS/Android) or your preferred third-party equalizer. To see frequency response and isolation charts for any of our top picks, scroll to the end of each photo gallery. The WH-1000XM5 offers top-of-the-line specs and features, including a custom equalizer, Sony\\u2019s 360 Reality Audio, and auto-pause/play sensors. The Sony WH-1000MX5 includes speak-to-chat, which pauses your media when you are speaking to someone and resumes playback 30 seconds after so you don\\u2019t miss the person\\u2019s response. You also have Bluetooth multipoint which is a great productivity feature for those who like to keep an ear on their phone while connected to their laptop. The microphone system is among the best we\\u2019ve seen in a headset like this and cancels out background noise effectively no matter the conditions. Take a listen to two of our microphone demos below! If the price tag of the WH-1000XM5 is just a bit too high, you also can\\u2019t go wrong with the older Sony WH-1000XM4, which was previously our pick for best noise cancelling headphones. When comparing the Sony WH-1000XM5 to the WH-1000XM4, it\\u2019s clear that these headphones are closely related. Even though the XM5 model has better ANC and sound quality to boot, the Sony WH-1000XM4 is still worth getting if you don\\u2019t want to spend as much money. The fourth-generation headset shares many of the premium features found on the WH-1000XM5 and you can expect the older model to go on sale. If you want a budget alternative, the Sony WH-XB910N is a solid ANC headset if you can find it. However, you\\u2019ll only save $100, as the price tag is most often around $250. The fact of the matter is that good ANC is tough to get at a good price, and Sony currently has the best. True wireless earphones took the market by storm after being dominated by the Apple AirPods for so long. Now there\\u2019s plenty of competition, much of which offers a more compelling experience than most of Apple\\u2019s audio products. However, with the company\\u2019s latest release, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) is back on top of the pole for iOS users. These buds offer great ANC, sound quality to match, and sound better than the AirPods (3rd generation) simply by virtue of the fact that they can seal your ear canal. These earbuds bring a big improvement to ANC and battery life, and the retain the same IPX4 rating, which now also covers the charging case. Speaking of the charging case, that\\u2019s where a lot of the more notable changes come. The AirPods Pro (2nd generation) charging case features Apple\\u2019s new U1 chip, which makes it compatible with Apple\\u2019s Find My service and the new integrated speakers will emit a noise to help you find it. Much like all the other AirPods, this is best used with Apple devices. It only supports SBC and AAC Bluetooth codecs, so there\\u2019s no high quality codec for android users. Also, many of the earbuds software features are found in the iOS settings app, so you\\u2019ll miss out on other platforms in that respect too. Still, this is about as good as it gets for wireless earbuds for Apple users. The AirPods Pro mic sounds best in quiet environments but can filter out some background noise. Listen to our samples below. Sennheiser combines most of what you want in a great set of over-ear Bluetooth headphones in the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless. With support for a variety of high quality codecs like AAC, aptX, aptX HD, and aptX Adaptive, plus a 3.5mm headphone jack and USB-C listening, you\\u2019ll hardly ever get caught without a connection. You even get Bluetooth multipoint. More to the point, a stellar 56 hours and 21 minutes of battery life (with ANC on) outperforms most headphones. While the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless doesn\\u2019t beat out the Sony WH-1000XM5 on noise cancelling, the ANC onboard is still rather effective and adjustable. That sound experts at Sennheiser tune the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless to sound frankly great, is unsurprising. It gets very close to our target curve with just a bit more bass. However, if that sound is not your preference, you can utilize the Smart Control app to adjust EQ. In addition you can create automatic listening settings for different locations and adjust ANC. The touch controls are intuitive, and little luxuries like on-ear detection contribute to the overall flagship worthy experience of the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless. That you get a carry case and an airplane adapter means you don\\u2019t have to shell out for accessories either. Plus, the Sennheiser cans undercut the price of most premium headphones without significant compromises. Sennheiser does a pretty good job with the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless, although, it has some issues with noise rejection, but nothing unusual for headphones without booms. Take a listen to the following demo recordings. Though people have been picking the Sony MDR-7506 for decades, a true successor in the \\u201cbudget monitor headphone\\u201d category has finally taken center stage. The AKG K371 offers a really good baseline for what constitutes good sound in the consumer market. That\\u2019s not because these are super bassy, or that they\\u2019re flashy\\u2014if anything they\\u2019re the opposite of both. This pair of headphones sounds excellent for what it is, and provides a really good double-life as a dependable studio monitor. Sure, these are a set of wired cans with a rather cumbersome cable. But if you\\u2019re listening at home, mixing a track, or working at the coffee shop: these are the headphones you want. Sure, you could spend thousands of dollars on headphones that may or may not sound better, but the HiFiMan Sundara is at the perfect crossroads between affordability and top-tier performance. Sure, that sounds a little weird to say for a set of $300 USD planar magnetic headphones, but our testing shows the Sundara does an excellent job at providing listeners with good sound quality when compared to its closest competitors. However, many headphones in this bracket are very heavy and uncomfortable, and the Sundara has this issue to an extent. However, the choice to use cloth in the padding of the ear cups and the form-fitting band do a lot to make this product far more comfortable to use for those who wear eyeglasses. If you don\\u2019t wear eyeglasses, all the better. Of course, as open-back headphones, these let in just about every sound around you. So be sure to note that before you start spending like crazy. Additionally, if you\\u2019d like to equalize these headphones any: you\\u2019re probably going to want an amplifier of some sort to avoid volume issues. While the ANC on the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 may not be as impressive as the company\\u2019s Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones, Bose has shown commitment to users by improving the ANC with a comprehensive firmware updates (version 1.8.2). You can view the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 ANC chart. We also like the NCH 700 for its sleek design and seemingly perfect touch controls. Many companies make calibrate their headsets\\u2019 touch panels to be too sensitive, resulting in many misfires, but Bose\\u2019s headset is a breeze to operate. The default frequency response (chart) is excellent and requires little fixing, but you can change it directly from the Bose Music app (iOS/Android) if you\\u2019d like. Those with unusually low voices may sound a bit \\u201coff\\u201d or \\u201chollow\\u201d to those on the other end but this is to mitigate the proximity effect. For the most part, the NCH 700 microphone is quite good in all contexts since it filters out quite a bit of environmental noise. If you\\u2019re looking for the absolute best way to spend money on headphones for the computer, Drop\\u2019s partnership with Sennheiser brought a legendary audiophile option\\u2014the HD 650\\u2014down to roughly half the original asking price with the HD 6XX. Budget-conscious audiophiles would be doing themselves a disservice by not giving these a spin. There are a few minor differences between the HD 6XX and the HD 650 ($304.78 at Amazon), but most are cosmetic in nature. The performance of the HD 6XX is top-notch, and is much lighter than it looks. If you\\u2019re the kind of listener who spends a lot of time at the computer, this is the kind of headphones you should be looking for. Just be aware that the open back is a double-edged sword: it allows for better sound quality and clarity, but it also lets in all the outside noise around you. We can\\u2019t highlight every headset the way we\\u2019d like, so instead, we\\u2019ve put together a bulleted list of alternative standouts that didn\\u2019t quite make the best headphones cut. Some of our picks\\u2019 frequency response and isolation charts were measured with our old testing system. We have since purchased a Bruel & Kjaer 5128 test fixture (and the appropriate support equipment) to update our testing and data collection. It will take a while to update our backlog of old test results, but we will update this article (and many others!) once we\\u2019re able with improved sound quality measurements and isolation performance plots. These will be made obvious with our new chart aesthetic\\u00a0(black background instead of white). Thank you for bearing with us, and we hope to see you again once we\\u2019ve sorted everything out. Calling something \\u201cthe best\\u201d at anything is controversial at best, so we create our best lists with the caveat that your experiences may vary from our own. Sometimes people have a unique set of needs, and that can\\u2019t be satisfied by going to a list of \\u201cbest headphones\\u201d because the article doesn\\u2019t address what the best headphones out there are\\u2026\\u00a0for you. Consequently, we encourage all of our readers to write down all the things they want out of their headphones first\\u2014before rolling the dice on a pick. This list has a lot of all-time greats, but if you need something a little bit more tailored to\\u00a0your needs, definitely keep reading our other lists and features to arm yourself with enough knowledge to make the right purchase. Think hard about what types of headphones you like (in ears? over ears? on ears?), and also try to figure out what features you need. Maybe you need to go to the store to see how they fit on your head? Do you wear glasses or have ear piercings? Maybe you should look into getting velour pads instead of leather! These are all things covered in our reviews and other best lists. This list has a few wired options if you want great sound, but we also have a few wireless options if you prefer convenience. If you opt for a Bluetooth pair, there are a few things you should know. First and foremost, the rumors you\\u2019ve heard are true. Bluetooth just can\\u2019t party with wired headphones, at least as it pertains to sound quality. Even some of the best codecs available aren\\u2019t as great as they seem at first glance. AAC is basically only good if you\\u2019re on an iOS device which means Android users should probably stick to aptX, and LDAC isn\\u2019t truly hi-res. The good news is that you most likely can\\u2019t hear any of the details in the data that\\u2019s being dropped, but it\\u2019s still not a great selling point. Of course, if you do think that you have superhuman hearing feel free to test yourself with our simple hearing test. There is hope, though: Bluetooth SIG announced LE Audio and the LC3 codec, an efficient alternative to SBC. We\\u2019re excited to see the benefits to the hard-of-hearing community play out in the real world, and know that LC3 will provide a 50% increase in audio quality relative to SBC. What\\u2019s more, headphone stutters will be lessened as packet-loss-management is improved, so instead of hearing annoying, intermittent drops, the dropout process will be much smoother. Even the best headphones will benefit from the new codec. We mentioned codecs in the last section, but what exactly is a Bluetooth codec? If Bluetooth is the technology that enables two devices to communicate with each other, then codecs can be thought of as the language that they speak. When two devices speak the same language, they can communicate faster and send more data between each other which results in better sound quality. Some of the best codecs have high transfer rates if both devices are compatible, and if they aren\\u2019t then everything just reverts down to the basic codec called SBC. Unfortunately, codecs can be a bit finicky and as we mentioned before don\\u2019t always work the way they\\u2019re intended to which is why wired headphones usually sound better. Though it is worth mentioning that Qualcomm\\u2019s aptX adaptive that seems promising, but we\\u2019ll have to wait to test it ourselves before we get our hopes up. If you were wondering how active noise cancellation works, don\\u2019t worry you\\u2019re not alone. There\\u2019s a lot that goes into it and some companies like Bose and Sony have their own ways of achieving it technologically, but it all comes down to basic physics. Active noise cancelling is actually something called destructive interference. If you take one wave with an amplitude of +1 and combine it with another wave that has an amplitude of -1, you\\u2019re left with zero. Active noise cancelling headphones take advantage of this by using tiny microphones to hear what sounds are around you and then creating an opposite sound wave to cancel that before it reaches your ears. Of course, this isn\\u2019t perfect and works better for long, droning sounds then sudden, screeching ones. So don\\u2019t expect ANC headphones to block out that crying baby on your next flight. But when you combine noise cancelling technology with good isolation, you can get pretty close to completely blocking the outside world. This is harder to achieve when it comes to earbuds, as they don\\u2019t completely cover your ear. So instead, a solid pair of memory foam ear tips might be worth looking into as they do a better job at isolating sound than the silicone ones that come with most buds. If you\\u2019d seen this list before, you\\u2019ll probably notice that it\\u2019s completely different than it was in years past. Now it\\u2019s a perpetually updated piece. Gone is the Sennheiser HD 800, and the rest of the exorbitantly expensive headphones. That\\u2019s because we realized that what\\u2019s \\u201cbest\\u201d objectively, isn\\u2019t what\\u2019s \\u201cbest\\u201d for everyone\\u2026 so our selections needed a bit of tweaking. Just like it is with power tools and kitchen utensils, different headphones are built for different purposes. Using the right tool for the job is important, and ensures that you get the best experience possible. You wouldn\\u2019t use a chainsaw to cut butter any more than you\\u2019d use a set of AKG K7XX on an airplane. In that light, we took extra time to take into account how most people actually use headphones. What makes a good pair of gym headphones? What makes a good pair of wireless earbuds? What\\u2019s the good in having a best headphones list that doesn\\u2019t help most people buy headphones they like? While we took the time to highlight some Bluetooth headphones, active noise cancelers, and open-backed cans\\u2014be sure to read the descriptions to see if they\\u2019re right for you. Many people want a set of headphones that will do everything, but those models are few and far between. That\\u2019s why our winner isn\\u2019t a set of headphones you\\u2019d see on other outlets\\u2019 top 10. It\\u2019s more about what people actually want than what\\u2019s objectively the best performing set out there. While many might be upset that we chose more consumer-geared models than the stunning halo products of audiophile lore: it\\u2019s important to us that our readers aren\\u2019t dissatisfied with their headphones. To that end, we find that the ultra-expensive headphones are generally a poor fit for most, often leaving your average consumer frustrated and feeling like they wasted a lot of money. Those with a more developed idea of what kind of headphones they want should also check out our other best lists. Not every best headphone model listed here will meet all of your needs. With that being said, all of our picks were used by at least one team member, and all of these picks sound fantastic. Because our ad-free business model relies on you enjoying your headphones without returning them, this list represents what we earnestly feel is the most deserving of your money. We knew that we wanted to create a list of financially attainable headphones that meet realistic use cases, rather a drool-inducing, unrealistic list for your average consumer. In short, you should trust us because we show our work, strive to provide as much unimpeachable information to you, and pin our revenue model on the happiness of our readers with our recommendations. If you return the product we suggest, we don\\u2019t see a dime. When it comes to audio, the SoundGuys team has years of experience reviewing products between them (and even more listening to them). Chris spent years reviewing audio products, among other things, at publications such as USA Today and Reviewed.com, Lily clocked in countless hours at radio stations and reviewing products independently before joining our team, and Adam has been listening to headphones and speakers for nearly five years as part of SoundGuys. So needless to say, if a product makes best headphones list it\\u2019s because we were genuinely impressed by them and had some hands-on experience with them (or at the very least put in hours of research). I wish I could give you a definitive answer of one perfect pair of\\u00a0wireless headphones, but truthfully, the answer to this question depends on your personal preferences. Do you want really good active noise cancelling? Go for the\\u00a0Apple AirPods Max or Sony WH-1000XM5. Are you looking for great wireless sound quality and don\\u2019t want to spend a fortune? Check out the Audio-Technica AT-M50xBT2. Is long battery life important to you? Try the Anker Soundcore Space Q45. There are a lot of good headphones out there, and we do our best to outline all the objective facts and describe our subjective experiences with each product so you can make an informed decision based on your personal priorities. The\\u00a0Apple AirPods Max are bound to be a fine pair of headphones for any iPhone user, but the noise cancelling headset is extremely cost-prohibitive. It affords a lot to the right listener, though. Each ear cup houses Apple\\u2019s H1 chip for extensive processing power so the headset can deftly perform tasks like hybrid ANC, passthrough audio, hands-free Siri access, Spatial Audio, and more. If you have multiple Apple devices all synced up to the same iCloud account, you\\u2019ll enjoy automatic device switching. The Sony WH-1000XM4\\u00a0feature several upgrades from the\\u00a0Sony WH-1000XM3 including improved noise cancelling, Bluetooth multipoint, and speak to chat functionality. That being said, the WH-1000XM3 is still an excellent pair of headphones, if outdated compared the even newer, WH-1000XM5.\"}, {\"link\": \"https://www.rtings.com/headphones/reviews/best/headphones\", \"favicon\": \"data:image/png;base64,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\", \"title\": \"The 9 Best Headphones - Spring 2023: Reviews\", \"text\": \"A great pair of headphones shouldn't only sound rich and balanced but should also be comfortable, versatile, well-built, and feature-packed.

See our picks for the\\u00a0best Bluetooth earbuds, the\\u00a0best wireless headphones, and the\\u00a0best noise cancelling headphones. The Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless are the best headphones we've tested. These versatile premium over-ears have an ANC system that does an outstanding job of blocking ambient sound, including rumbling engines and background conversations, so they're a great choice for commuting or traveling. Their battery lasts for roughly 37 hours with the ANC on, so you don't need to worry about running out of power during long days on the go. While Sony recently released a newer edition of these headphones, the Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless, they aren't as comfortable for most people, and their ANC has a hard time blocking out noise in the bass range. These comfortable headphones have a bass-heavy default sound profile that emphasizes the thump and rumble in genres like EDM and hip-hop. If you prefer a different sound, it can also be customized with a graphic EQ and presets in their companion app. Unfortunately, even with the EQ, you may find their sound somewhat muddy and cluttered. If that's a deal-breaker for you, you may want to consider the Bose QuietComfort 45/QC45 Wireless instead, which have a more neutral default sound profile with less overall bass. However, their ANC doesn't block out as much noise, and they have shorter continuous battery life. From this price point onwards, Anker dominates the market. Their Q lineup targets each price range, and most options in the lineup are well-equipped with features like ANC, multi-device pairing, and companion app support, which make them hard to ignore. That said, their top-of-the-line model is the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless, which are significantly cheaper than the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless, but come with a step down in build quality and comfort, as well as shorter continuous battery life. Still, they offer a few of the same features and have a comparable noise cancelling performance. Their ANC does a fantastic job of blocking out a wide range of ambient sound, although it's not quite as effective with bass-range sounds like rumbling engines as the Sony. You can set the ANC to different levels manually or use the 'Adaptive ANC' feature to adjust automatically to your surroundings. Their v-shaped default sound profile is well-suited for genres like pop and rock and can also be customized with a graphic EQ and presets in the companion app. They also support LDAC, Sony's proprietary codec for hi-res audio. They last for around 27 hours of continuous use and have physical controls in the form of buttons on the ear cups, which you might prefer if you want to adjust the volume while wearing gloves. Unlike the Sony headphones, they don't have virtual surround sound or customization options like button mapping, but they support multi-device pairing and NFC for quicker pairing. The Wyze Noise-Cancelling Headphones Wireless are a solid middle-of-the-road pick since they offer many of the same features as the higher-end Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless but at a lower price point. Although their ANC doesn't block out as much ambient sound, particularly when it comes to the rumbles of bus and plane engines, they're better suited for cutting down office chatter. They also have a comfortable, well-built fit for long listening sessions. You can even stay connected to your PC and smartphone simultaneously, thanks to their multi-device pairing support. Out of the box, they have a v-shaped sound profile that delivers extra warmth and boom, while sibilants like cymbals are bright. Their companion app also offers a graphic EQ and presets so that you can finetune their sound to your liking. They last over 22 hours continuously too. If you're looking for over-ears with a longer battery life, you'll want to consider the Anker Soundcore Life Q35 Wireless instead. They deliver over 44 hours continuously, so you can go for a few days without having to recharge them. However, they leak audio at high volumes, so if you want to crank up your favorite tunes, others around you can hear parts of it. If you're looking for a cheaper pair of headphones,\\u00a0look at another offering from Anker, the Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Wireless. They're an earlier version of the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless\\u00a0and aren't as well-built. However, they offer a better overall ANC performance than their successor and do a better job blocking out bass-range sounds like engine noise during your commute. They support multi-device pairing and have a similarly comfortable fit for most people. Their battery lasts for about 44 hours continuously with ANC on, and they're equipped with an auto-off timer to help save power. They have an excited sound profile that gives the audio extra bass and sparkly vocals, which makes them well-suited for genres like rock and pop. Their app also includes a graphic EQ and presets that you can use to adjust their sound to your taste. Unfortunately, their sound seems more hollow and thin when the ANC is turned off. They have a worse overall mic performance, so you may want to keep that in mind if you want headphones for phone calls and online meetings. If you're on a tight budget, check out the Logitech G435 LIGHTSPEED Wireless. While they're no-frills gaming headphones and have a smaller overall fit since they're aimed at teens and tweens, they're still worth considering if you're looking for wireless headphones. Their warm sound profile is well-suited for gaming and music, as they can help emphasize sound effects while keeping vocals and instruments bright in mixes. Unlike other casual use picks on this list, they also have a more open and spacious soundstage to help immerse you in your audio. These over-ears have a comfortable and lightweight fit, though their build quality is quite plasticky and doesn't feel the most sturdy. That said, they don't have ANC and don't block out much background noise, which can be frustrating in noisy commutes or office settings. Their battery doesn't last as long as the Anker Life Q30 Wireless continuously either, although their under 20 hours of playtime time will still be enough for most use cases. However, if you're looking for longer-lasting over-ears and don't mind paying a little more, it's worth checking out the Anker Soundcore Life Q20 Wireless. Like other models in the Q lineup, they last over 30 hours with their ANC on. However, this model lacks an auto-off timer to help conserve battery life when not in use. The Sennheiser HD 800 S are the best audiophile headphones we've tested if you're looking for an immersive audio experience. If you have the budget, these premium over-ears offer some of the best sound money can buy. However, you'll need to purchase a high-grade amp if you want to properly drive them, which can be an additional investment if you don't already have one. They have an open-back design, which allows audio to escape the ear cups and bounce off the walls around you, creating a spacious and open passive soundstage. On the flip side, they're designed for use in an enclosed room as they won't block out any background noise and leak audio across the range. While this isn't a problem if you're listening to tracks in a quiet space like a studio, audio bleed can ruin a recording, while ambient sound can make it harder to monitor a live session properly. They also have a well-balanced and neutral sound suitable for most audio content. Although they have trouble reproducing a thumpy low-bass, they have a touch of extra high-bass to add warmth to audio. Their mid-range is flat, so vocals and lead instruments are clearly and accurately reproduced. They also have excellent build quality, and their fit is comfortable enough for long listening sessions. Unlike casual-use headphones, the price range for mid-level audiophile headphones is quite large, and\\u00a0there are many options available\\u00a0at different costs. That said, the HiFiMan Edition XS stand out from the pack, and even though they're more upper mid-range in price, they offer a performance that rivals other high-end models. These open-backs have planar-magnetic drivers instead of more common dynamic drivers like the Sennheiser HD 800 S. Although they have a larger, bulkier frame due to their driver design, it helps them reproduce bass more accurately and create an immersive audio experience. As a result, they have a very neutral sound profile with clear and present vocals and lead instruments. Their passive soundstage also seems fairly natural, wide, and spacious. However, they aren't as well-built as our top pick, and their headband feels heavier than other headphones in this manufacturer's lineup. It may be problematic if you want to wear them for long periods, so you may want to check out the HiFiMan Sundara 2020 instead. They're not only more affordable, but their ski-band headband can distribute the weight more evenly across your head, resulting in a more comfortable overall fit. That said, they produce sound audio less consistently and create a less out-of-head passive soundstage. If you're on a tight budget or are looking for an inexpensive first pair of audiophile headphones, the Philips SHP9500 are the best entry-level option we've tested. Their fairly neutral sound is suitable for a wide range of genres. They lack more low-bass than the HiFiMan Edition XS, but there's a bump in the high-bass range that adds warmth to help make up for the missing thump and rumble. The mid-range response is very accurate, so vocals and lead instruments are clear and detailed, and the treble is somewhat overemphasized, which adds brightness. Like the other audiophile headphones on this list, they have an open-back design that helps them create a wide, spacious soundstage, although it can seem less natural than the HiFiMan Edition XS'. Their cheaper price doesn't mean sacrificing comfort, meaning most people can wear them for long listening sessions without fatigue. However, they aren't as well-built as the previous pick. The materials feel plasticky, and the padding seems prone to tearing. On the plus side, these wired headphones have a detachable cable, so it's easy to replace if it gets damaged. The best earbuds we've tested are the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II Truly Wireless. Earbuds have the benefit of portability and can be a great choice for a variety of uses, from work to workouts. These are an updated version of the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds Truly Wireless and have an improved ANC performance. They can isolate you very effectively from a broad range of ambient sound, including rumbling engines and background conversations. Their sound profile also has more bass than our rig measured, but this is due to the shape of our rig's ear canals affecting the buds' bass delivery. Subjectively, their bass-rich sound profile brings out the thump and rumble in genres like EDM. While this muddies vocals and instruments, if you prefer a different sound, it can also be adjusted with a graphic EQ and presets in the companion app. They support the aptX Adaptive codec, which helps lower latency and improve audio quality via Bluetooth. Their roughly eight-hour continuous battery life can last through a day of work, and they have a comfortable fit for most people. There's a selection of differently-sized ear tips and stability fins included. Once you get a good fit, they're stable enough to stay in place if you use them at the gym or on a run. However, they aren't as well-built as the first Bose QuietComfort earbuds or other premium buds like the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Truly Wireless. Those earbuds have a weaker ANC performance, but you might like their smaller design and features for iOS users, like virtual surround sound and easy pairing.

Aug 22, 2022:\\n                We've added the AKG N700NC M2 and the Anker Soundcore Life Q35 to highlight the wide range of headphones available at different price points. We've also replaced the Apple AirPods Pro with the Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 3, as the Sennheiser offer better noise isolation and more customization, and added some picks to Notable Mentions that didn't quite make the cut.

Here\\u2019s how it works. The absolute best headphones in every style, for every budget. Yes, there are newer models available, but we still rate the Sony WH-1000XM4 as the best headphones for most people when balancing performance and price. The audio quality is rich and exuberant, the noise cancellation is strong, they work wired or wireless, and they offer great battery life. For some very affordable earbuds that offer excellent audio quality, the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus remain among our favorites \\u2013 they're just an incredible price these days. Matt Bolton, Managing Editor \\u2013 Entertainment. The best headphones are a must if you love listening to music, podcasts and movies. They\\u2019re essential if you travel regularly, have a lot of video calls, need music to focus while you\\u2019re working or to keep you motivated while you\\u2019re working out. There are many different types of headphones out there, and new ones are launched every week, which means finding the best headphones or the best earbuds for you isn\\u2019t easy. You have to consider several factors, including your budget, the features you need and any preferences you have about how they look and fit. For sheer sound quality you can't beat a good pair of wired headphones. But if you want the convenience of cable-free listening there are some excellent unwired options too. In fact, there are so many that we've put together two separate guides: one for the best wireless headphones and one for the best true wireless earbuds. We've also put together a guide to the best noise-cancelling headphones. They're particularly good for travelling or for drowning out the ambient noise of open-plan offices. If you're on a tight budget, though, some of the best over-ear headphones' ear cups do a pretty good job of cutting out ambient noise without any technological trickery. We've spent many happy hours testing the best earbuds and headphones over the years and over our ears, and we know exactly what makes a great pair of cans or buds: sound quality, of course, but also comfort and convenience. And you don't necessarily need to spend huge sums of money to get all three of those things, as this guide demonstrates. There's a huge variety of headphones and earbuds here, but they share important features that make them easy to recommend. Those features include comfortable design, class-leading audio performance, and useful extra features such as built-in voice assistants or rock-solid wireless connectivity. Whether you want to listen with your smartphone, laptop, or one of the best MP3 players, you won't be disappointed with any of these pairs \\u2013 but if you're looking for gaming headphones with built-in mics, we'd suggest checking out our best PC gaming headset guide, as that's laser-focused on gaming performance, surround sound and in-game chat. The Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones deliver excellent noise-cancellation and sound quality in a design that we found comfortable and lightweight throughout our testing. They don\\u2019t look different from their predecessors, the Sony WH-1000XM3. However, new features, including multipoint pairing, DSEE Extreme upscaling, conversational awareness and auto-play/pause using a built-in sensor, mean they\\u2019re a significant upgrade. The WH-1000XM4 headphones also support Sony\\u2019s 360 Reality Audio format, which delivers spatial audio on stereo headphones, plus the LDAC codec that can send a bitrate of up to 990 kbps. However, it no longer supports aptX or aptX HD, so your hi-res audio support mileage may vary. There are a wonderful pair of wireless noise-cancelling headphones and deliver exactly what they promise and then some thanks to their exceptional noise cancellation and cutting-edge codec support. Read our full Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Headphones review. Now that they've received a permanent price cut, dragging that tag down to more than half its original price, the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus are a much more appealing option than ever. Not that they weren't already at their original cost, receiving the coveted five-star rating in our review. A clear upgrade from its predecessors, these offering excellent audio performance, a helpful app, and easy-to-use controls. In terms of audio quality, we found during testing that they offer tons of dynamism and character, with a lively presentation, high accuracy, and a lot of detail. And, while there's no noise cancellation on offer, the sound isolation is very good. Finally, if you're ok with using them in low power mode, you should get up to nine hours of battery life per earbuds charge (up to 45 hours with the case). Read our full Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus review. We said under intense review that Sennheiser's welcome update to its 2019 Sennheiser Momentum third-generation Wireless headphones would soon be sitting pretty within this buying guide, and here they are. The Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless are the newest August 2022-issue wireless over-ear headphones from Sennheiser and if Sony (listed above and below) isn't worried, it should be. These cans boast an incredible 60-hour battery life, a likeable app, an extensive feature set, easy on-ear controls, talented adaptive noise cancellation and a zealous sound that'll have you nodding your head happily wherever you go.\\u00a0Yes, they're a tad plain aesthetically, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and these headphones sound outrageously good for the level. Sennheiser has packed everything and the kitchen sink into the Momentum 4 Wireless\\u2019s spec sheet, including Sidetone to better hear your voice during calls and \\u00a0'Sound Zones', EQ and ANC presets which can be set to magically kick in when you're, well, in the zone. Make no mistake though, the headline-grabber is still the sound. And what a sound it is! Think open, detailed, expansive, neutral and crisp. Never is it overly warm; never is it congested or muddied through the bass. Move over Sony XM5, there's a new set of cans in town and honestly, they're just that little bit better across the board. Oh, also, they're a little cheaper than the XM5\\u2026. Read our full Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless review. These new Sonys would be at the top of our table if it weren't for the fact that right now the outgoing model, the WH-1000XM4, is substantially cheaper and does almost everything the newer Sonys do. These are better headphones, but at the moment the XM4s are the better buy. In our Sony WH-1000XM5 review we said that the XM5s are \\\"the best headphones in the world thanks to their class-leading noise-cancelling features and well-balanced audio\\\". However, \\\"a steeper price point and similar functionality to earlier models make the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones an ever-so-slightly tougher sell than before.\\\". The new design is more elegant and contains slightly smaller drivers than before, and while there's less wind distortion the trade-off is that they don't fold neatly like the previous model did. The noise cancelling is best-in-class, doing an excellent job of muting the higher pitched sounds that ANC headphones tend to find challenging, and sound quality is exemplary. Your co-workers or fellow commuters won't take a dislike to you either: these headphones don't leak as badly as some over-ears do. The other headline feature here is battery life, which is now 10 hours longer: expect up to 40 hours with the ANC off and 30 with it on. If you don't already have noise cancelling headphones, these are as good as it currently gets \\u2013\\u00a0but the older, cheaper model is almost as good and better value as a result. Read our full Sony WH-1000XM5 review. With the Sony WF-1000XM4s, Sony has combined performance, ergonomics, and build quality more effectively than ever before in a noise-cancelling true wireless package.\\u00a0During our testing we found that compared to their predecessors, the Sony WF-1000XM3, the newer wireless earbuds offer enough quality-of-life features to make them worth upgrading to, even if they are a little more expensive.\\u00a0Features like auto-pause and being able to tune the buds to the shape of your ears are truly useful. While other true wireless earbuds surpass the Sony WF-1000XM4 in particular areas \\u2013 in terms of noise cancellation, for example \\u2013 no other model comes close to offering such excellent quality across the board. That\\u2019s why the Sony WF-1000XM4 are hands-down the best true wireless earbuds you can buy today. Read our full Sony WF-1000XM4 review. The Apple AirPods Pro 2 offer improved audio performance over the original AirPods Pro and fantastic ANC in a comfortable, true wireless form factor. The Pro 2 buds are a step up from the original AirPods Pro. Design changes might be subtle, but audio performance is upgraded with new drivers and amplifiers. During our testing, we rated the sound from the Pro 2 as brilliant\\u2014there\\u2019s rich audio across genres and a wide and expansive soundstage. ANC is also greatly improved and performs exceptionally well, we found it blocked out most external noises. Transparency mode is more useful too. It's adaptive, allowing you to have natural conversations when you don\\u2019t want to take them out. Battery life has been boosted to 6 hours from the buds with ANC on, and 30 hours from the charging case, which is now IPX4 water resistant\\u2014withstanding light showers and sweating\\u2014and has a speaker, handy if you lose them as you can activate a 'Find My' request. We still rate the original AirPods Pro, but the Pro 2 are one of our favorite options if you're looking for a pair of the best headphones in a true wireless design. If you want the comfort of over-ear headphones, there are better headphones on this list, like the Sony WH-1000XM4s at the top. But the AirPods Pro 2 prove you don't necessarily need an over-ear design anymore for truly immersive sound and excellent ANC from your headphones. Read our full Apple AirPods Pro 2 review. Samsung has truly turned a corner with its latest Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, which forego futuristic looks in favor of great 24-bit sound, head-tracked spatial audio and a design that fits comfortably. Apple, Sony, Bose, Sennheiser and in fact all of the\\u00a0best wireless earbuds\\u00a0manufacturers now need to take a good look at what Samsung has done with the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. They're good. No, really, they're\\u00a0good. These smaller, more comfortable and less arrogant earbuds (remember the rose gold, kidney-bean shaped Galaxy Buds Live? These are nothing like those) are packed full of useful perks such as excellent ANC, voice detect, wearer detection and customizable on-ear controls \\u2013 all of which work very well indeed \\u2013\\u00a0plus IPX7 water ingress protection. But the headline-grabber, if you own a Samsung Galaxy device (and thus, access to the Samsung Wearable companion app and home-screen widget) is 360 audio with optional head-tracking, thus allowing you to use your phone as the focal point to direct more of that new end-to-end 24-bit high-res audio to whichever ear you prefer. Read our full Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro review. After testing the 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Headphones for a few weeks, we're certain that they deliver fantastic sound and equally fantastic value for money. That's why we consider them to be the best headphones for those who prefer wired earbuds. For $100 / \\u00a3100 (about AU$168), it\\u2019s hard to find a better-sounding and more well-built pair of earphones than the 1MORE Triple Drivers \\u2013\\u00a0although if you want a little extra refinement and more luxurious materials, the same firm's 1MORE Quad Drivers are even more impressive, albeit at twice the price. But at this price, and with such excellent build and design, it\\u2019s hard to fault the Triple Drivers. The inbuilt remote feels a little cheap, but that's more than made up for by the lush sound quality offered by these luxe-looking earbuds. For the price, you can't do better than 1MORE's Triple Driver in-ear headphones. Read our full 1More Triple Driver In-Ear\\u00a0Headphone review. The SoundMagic E11BTs are an extremely capable pair of wireless in-ear earphones, and given their low price, it really is difficult to fault them. The audio quality on offer here is fantastic with vocals sounding clear and smooth, while a hefty amount of bass helps elsewhere. Treble frequencies are sharp and crystal-clear too with a good level of attack. Although we also found that they might be a little harsh for anyone who wants to have a very warm soundstage. We found these headphones comfortable to wear thanks to their ergonomically designed eartips, and we thought they looked elegant too. They're \\u00a0attached to a flat neckband that didn't irritate our skin while running or working out. They have an IPX4 rating, which means they should withstand sweaty sessions, so they're a solid option as a spare pair of workout earbuds. Read our full SoundMagic E11BT review. When we first reviewed the original Lypertek PurePlay Z3 true wireless earbuds (then known as the Lypertek Tevi), we were blown away. The Lypertek PurePlay Z3 2.0 true wireless earbuds are their successors. They\\u2019re similar to the originals, include a few key improvements, and are available at the same affordable price point of $99 / \\u00a399. That price gets you everything we loved about the original PurePlay Z3, including detailed balanced sound, a whopping 80 hours total battery life from its petite USB-C charging case, and a comfortably fitting bud with physical buttons. But the Z3 2.0 earbuds also add wireless charging, a powerful new LDX Audio mode, improved app functionality and a hear-through ambient mode. The bad news is that we found the app connectivity to be patchy, and the ambient hear through mode isn't a patch on what you get from the likes of Sony\\u2019s noise cancelling WF-1000XM4. The hear-through mode is a shame, then, but these remain very impressive earbuds in terms of sound quality, stamina and affordability. They're more than a match for headphones two or three times the price. Read our full Lypertek PurePlay Z3 2.0 review. Sonically, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 are now the wireless over-ear headphones to beat. There, we said it. If that's all you need to hear, thank you for reading this particular buying guide. But if you want to know why we said \\\"sonically\\\" rather than \\\"across the board\\\", and why we gave them four-and-a-half stars rather than the full five, read on. The simple fact is that the B&W PX8 are expensive. There are good, tangible, understandable reasons for this \\u2013\\u00a0a new carbon cone 40mm drive unit replaces the bio-cellulose driver in the more affordable\\u00a0Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2 and the die-cast aluminum arms, diamond-cut bright metal detailing and Nappa leather trim elevates the build to high-end territory \\u2013\\u00a0but for some, anything priced hotter than the\\u00a0AirPods Max\\u00a0is too rich for the blood given the current financial climate. We hear you. But we have also heard the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 headphones and, cost of living crisis or no, they're exceptional. Read our full Bowers & Wilkins PX8 review. If the Sony WH-1000XM4s are the current king of noise-cancelling headphones, the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are next in line for the throne. We think the Sonys sound slightly better, but the Bose noise cancelling is superior \\u2013\\u00a0so if you're a frequent flyer these may well be the better option for you. By applying noise cancellation to phone calls as well as music, Bose has made great strides in the field of noise-cancelling headphones. We found the sound quality to be undeniably good, with a vibrant, lively character and well-balanced soundstage. If you\\u2019re trying to decide between buying the Sony WH-1000XM4s and these Bose headphones, we\\u2019d recommend going for the former because of that lower price and better battery life \\u2013 they're our number one pick for those reasons. But you wouldn\\u2019t be making a mistake if you opted for the Bose cans instead (and we wouldn\\u2019t blame you if you did) \\u2013 they sound great, look stunning, and the noise cancellation is out of this world. Read our full Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 review. This is Bose\\u2019s second attempt at a set of true wireless headphones, and the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are leaps and bounds better than the older SoundSport Free. The design of these earbuds much improved and the noise cancellation is also exemplary. There are ten levels of ANC on offer here. At maximum, you\\u2019re practically cut off from the rest of the world, encased in a cocoon of sound that\\u2019s made entirely of your favourite tunes. You\\u2019ll only be able to hear some of the highest frequency sounds such as sirens, and even they\\u2019re muted to a large degree. The Bose headphones aren't quite as bassy as Sony's rivals, but we enjoyed their superb clarity and consistently impressive sound quality. During our testing, we found these noise-cancelling earbuds incredibly comfortable and well balanced, too, and while we expected their bulky form factor to be an issue they're much more comfortable than they look. Read our full Bose QuietComfort Earbuds review. For just $79 / \\u00a369/ AU$99, the Jabra Elite 45h gives you Bluetooth 5 connectivity, 40mm full-range dynamic drivers and a smattering of physical push-button controls in a wireless on-ear frame. We like how the faux leather, memory foam and happily un-creaky plastic combined to deliver a fit we found extremely comfortable, although we weren't so keen on the way in which the ear pads reflect body heat right back: these phones get rather warm when you've been wearing them for a while. Tech-wise, they hit all the key features. There\\u2019s voice control available from Amazon Alexa,\\u00a0Google Assistant, or Siri. Jabra\\u2019s Sound+ control app even walks you through a brief hearing test to establish exactly how the EQs should be set to best suit your ears, giving you a surprisingly personal experience compared to others in this price range. By the standards of overtly affordable headphones, the Elite 45h are feature-packed. Read our full Jabra Elite 45h review. Testing the Sony WH-CH510, we were amazed that wireless on-ear headphones could cost this little while delivering really decent sound, a USB-C port, and 35 hours of battery life. If you\\u2019re looking for headphones at this price point, you\\u2019re likely already willing to make a few sacrifices. Thankfully, most of the compromises Sony has made with the WH-CH510 haven\\u2019t been too crucial \\u2013 the lack of analog input mirrors, the loss of the 3.5mm port on most modern smartphones \\u2013 and while the construction is a little plasticky they're lightweight, portable and comfortable. While they won\\u2019t have the superb clarity, balance, and sense of space that their WH-1000XM4 siblings deliver, the sound these on-ear headphones produce is much better than you'd expect from their size and price. You\\u2019ll find most genres perform well here, although tracks that already have low mids and bumped treble might get uncomfortably exaggerated. Read our full Sony WH-CH510 review. If money's no object, the Focal Stellia headphones could be the best headphones on the planet. The wide open soundstage on offer here and detailed, accurate sound treatment means they make any genre of music sound brilliant. If you listen to songs you think you know inside out, the precise separation of the frequencies here means that you will probably hear details you\\u2019ve never noticed before. If you like to keep things minimal in the headphones department, you probably won\\u2019t like the showy, opulent design of the Focal Stellias, and they definitely do feel a little chunky for wearing on the commute into work.\\u00a0But if you like a bit of luxury, the full-grain leather cups, woven cables, brushed copper accents, and matching carrying case are likely to appeal. That luxury feel is translated right down to the presentation of the user manuals in a neat little leather-style wallet. But then you'd expect to find this level of detail when you're parting with $3,000 / \\u00a32,799 (about AU$4,200).\\u00a0Ouch. Read our full Focal Stellia headphones review. Why you can trust TechRadar \\n\\n\\nWe spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you\\u2019re buying the best. Find out more about how we test. There's a lot to consider when you're buying a new pair of headphones. But the most important is the design. This doesn't just dictate how they look, but the features on offer, how they feel when you wear them and how you'll use them day-to-day. In-ear headphones, also called earbuds or earphones, are usually the cheapest and easiest way to pump audio into your ears.\\u00a0They rest in or just outside the ear canal, creating a tight seal to keep air out and sound in. These are the most discreet designs you'll find, making them excellent for portability and the prime choice for athletes. Over-ear headphones generally provide fantastic richness and depth of sound, which allows listeners to pick apart the instruments and sounds much easier. Additionally, over-ear, or circumaural headphones, go around the ear and offer a generous amount of padding. Instead of enveloping your ears, on-ear headphones create a light, breathable seal around your ear. The noise isolation is less effective than in-ear or over-ear options. But they're usually more portable than their over-ear brethren, appeal to travellers and make good fitness headphones. Some headphones don't go anywhere near your ears at all. Bone-conducting headphones send vibrations through your cheekbones and jaw up towards your inner ear, leaving your ears free. These headphones make great running headphones and swimming headphones. Wireless headphones fit into three different categories. Wireless in-ear\\u00a0earphones\\u00a0connected via a neckband are ideal for runners who want the freedom of a wireless connection with the security of a wire keeping their earbuds firmly around their neck. With wireless\\u00a0on-ear headphones and over-ear headphones, you simply lose the wire connecting them to your device \\u2013 otherwise, they look pretty much the same as your regular pair of wired cans, and give you the noise-isolating prowess of over-ears without the need for cumbersome wires to connect to your device. True wireless earbuds have no cord whatsoever. For some, this means true freedom; for others, untethered true wireless means constant danger of losing their expensive audio kit down the drain \\u2013 or terrible connections.\\u00a0The latter, at least, has changed now \\u2013 thanks to advances in Bluetooth technology like aptX HD, the best true wireless earbuds\\u00a0have never sounded better. Generally speaking, wired headphones do deliver better sound quality than wireless headphones. But there have been so many advances in audio tech in recent years, that with many of the best wireless headphones you're unlikely to notice a difference. That's why we often recommend audiophiles continue to opt for wired headphones. But for everyone else, it's mostly be down to personal preference. If wireless headphones suit you and are more convenient, they're a better choice for you. Get a good quality pair and you won't be missing out when it comes to sound quality. That depends on your preferences, style and budget. One of the most important considerations is design. Do you want a pair of in-ear headphones for running that are discrete and will stay snug all-day? Do you want a pair of true wireless headphones to give you ultimate flexibility? Or how about a big pair of over-ear headphones, the ultimate in noise cancellation and comfort? We've included a number of different headphone types below, like in-ear, on-ear, over-ear, wireless and true wireless. However, our top pick has to be the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones. They're fantastic all-rounders, offering a long battery life, noise cancellation, and excellent audio quality for the price. There's no one perfect headphone brand out there. It all depends on your budget, audio needs, the features you want, and even the comfort or design involved with the headphones. That's why we've included numerous headphones covering different price ranges and feature sets. While major brands like Sony and Bose may stand out most, that doesn't mean you shouldn't rule out the others, with something for everyone out there. When it comes to the best headphones, we focus on sound quality above everything else. We look at both wired and wireless cans and earbuds that would appeal to audiophiles, as well as those working in professional roles. However, we also appreciate that budget is important too, so we compare like for like, picking out budget headphones that perform admirably for the price. We also look at other features such as ANC, battery life, fit, and of course the usability and extra perks offered by any companion apps. Of course, design and whether they look (and feel) good all adds to the model's desirability \\u2013\\u00a0and this is noted as we listen to music across a wide range of genres over several days. We have tested all of the headphones in this guide extensively, spending plenty of time analyzing the sound, fit, design, specs, and value for money so that you will be able to choose a product you'll be over the moon with.

The best of these wireless options combine stellar audio with powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) and other handy tools to create as complete a package as possible. Of course, some companies do this better than others. For Engadget\\u2019s best wireless headphones guide, we tested out a number of different models with a variety of features, including noise cancellation and sound quality. Plus, our favorites span a range of prices so you can decide how much you\\u2019re comfortable spending. Until another company can pack in as many features as Sony, and do so with a stellar mix of sound and effective ANC, the crown is safe with the WH-1000XM5. Sony\\u2019s 1000X line has been our top pick for best wireless headphone for a long time now. Until another company can pack in as many features as Sony, and do so with a stellar mix of sound and effective ANC, the crown is safe. With the WH-1000XM5, Sony redesigned its flagship headphones, making them way more comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The company also made noticeable improvements to the active noise cancellation, adding a separate V1 chip in addition to the QN1 that was inside the M4. There are now eight total ANC mics as well \\u2013 the previous model only had four. This all combines to better block background noise and high frequencies, including human voices. The 1000XM5 still has all of the features that typically make Sony\\u2019s top-of-the-line headphones showstoppers. That includes 30-hour battery life and crisp, clear sound with balanced tuning and punchy bass. A combo of touch controls and physical buttons give you on-board access to music, calls and noise modes without reaching for your phone. Speak-to-Chat automatically pauses audio when you begin talking, and like previous Sony headphones, the M5 can change noise modes based on your activity or location. Plus, this model offers better call quality than most of the competition. The only real downside is that they\\u2019re $50 more than the WH-1000XM4 at full price ($400). Bowers & Wilkins pair impressive audio quality with solid ANC performance in the Px7 S2, along with a more refined design that's comfortable and doesn\\u2019t look overly plasticky. I\\u2019ll admit I didn\\u2019t expect Bowers & Wilkins to make the year's best headphones list, or even be in contention for a spot. However, the company\\u2019s revised Px7 headphones impressed me during my review. The Px7 S2 are pricey at $399, but Bowers & Wilkins pair impressive audio quality with solid ANC performance. In fact, the Px7 S2 are my favorite headphones right now in terms of sound. There\\u2019s also a more refined design that doesn\\u2019t look overly plasticky and the headphones fit comfortably even after hours of use. Call quality, ambient sound and automatic pausing aren\\u2019t the best here, but they get the job done. At the end of the day, the design, sound quality and noise cancellation make the Px7 S2 a strong pick in the current true wireless headphone field. For just $79, you can expect a comfy fit and up to 60 hours of battery life, along with Bluetooth multipoint connectivity and onboard physical-button controls. Audio-Technica has introduced affordable wireless headphones in the past, and while they didn\\u2019t offer active noise cancellation, they\\u2019re still worth considering. The company\\u2019s latest is the M20xBT, a Bluetooth version of the A-T\\u2019s popular M20x wired cans. For just $79, you can expect a comfy fit and up to 60 hours of battery life. Bluetooth multipoint connectivity allows you to connect to multiple devices at once and physical buttons provide reliable on-board control. The design isn\\u2019t as refined as the company\\u2019s pricer models like the M50xBT2, but you get the bulk of what makes Audio-Technica\\u2019s cheaper options so good. The QC45 combines Bose\\u2019s excellent active noise cancellation with clear and balanced audio, plus an excellent 24-hour battery life. The Bose 700 was one of our top wireless Bluetooth headphones last time around, but the company recently revived a workhorse with the QuietComfort 45. The design is mostly unchanged from the previous QC models, which could be a deal breaker for some. Once you get past that though, the QC45 combines Bose\\u2019s excellent active noise cancellation with clear and balanced audio. You can expect up to 24 hours of battery life on a charge and a comfortable fit that doesn\\u2019t get tiresome during long listening sessions. We\\u2019ve already seen them on sale for $50 less than full price, which makes the QuietComfort 45 even more compelling. Along with an impressive 50-hour battery life with ANC, these Technics headphones have good sound quality and a comfortable fit. Back at CES 2022, Panasonic announced the EAH-A800: a new set of active noise canceling headphones under the iconic Technics brand. While most of the features are what you see on any number of wireless headphones, one figure stood out. The company says you can expect up to 50 hours of battery life on the A800, and that\\u2019s with active noise cancellation enabled. These are currently in my stable of review units for detailed analysis, but I have already tested them on a long flight. The ANC is impressive and they\\u2019re comfortable enough to avoid becoming a burden after several hours. Sound quality is also quite good (there\\u2019s LDAC support, too) and there are enough features here to justify the premium price tag. They don't come cheap, but the MW75 has an attractive design that takes cues from Master & Dynamic's MG20 gaming headset and mixes them with a combo of aluminum, leather and tempered glass. While Master & Dynamic is known for its design prowess, the company\\u2019s over-ear headphones were due for a refresh. With the MW75 that debuted in June, the company opted for a look that takes cues from its MG20 gaming headset and mixes them with a combo of aluminum, leather and tempered glass. The company\\u2019s trademark sound quality returns with multiple ANC modes and ambient sound options for a range of situations. At $599, the high-end looks don\\u2019t come cheap, but if you\\u2019re looking for something beyond the pure plastic fashion of most headphones, M&D has you covered. Sennheiser's Momentum 4 has an impressive 60-hour battery life and improved ANC performance, but albeit with a somewhat bland design. I\\u2019ll be honest, I had a hard time choosing between the Px7 S2 and the Momentum 4 for the runner-up spot this time around. However, Bowers & Wilkins gets the edge in terms of design even though the Px7 S2 and the Momentum 4 are very evenly matched on sound quality. They\\u2019re the two best-sounding sets of Bluetooth headphones I\\u2019ve tested this year \\u2013 and it\\u2019s not even close. Sennheiser does have an impressive 60-hour battery life in its favor and improved ANC performance. Those two items alone might be enough for you to overlook the very generic design. I typically look at three factors: design, sound quality and features. In terms of design, I\\u2019m usually looking to see if headphones feel cheap and plasticky. Plenty of companies use plastic, but they can do so in a way that doesn\\u2019t look or feel like budget models. For sound quality, I want to hear a nice, even tuning where highs, mids and lows are all well represented. No overly boomy bass or scooped out mids. I also want good clarity where you can pick up fine details and an open, immersive soundstage. Features is typically a distant third, but if a company doesn\\u2019t cover basic functionality (automatic pausing, transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth, etc.) it can be an indication of overall quality. \\u201cBest\\u201d can be pretty subjective, but I always recommend going to a place where you can listen to the headphones you\\u2019re thinking about buying before you commit. Sometimes this isn\\u2019t possible, so you\\u2019ll want to check return policies. I also recommend doing some research to determine what your priorities are in a new set. Do you want the best sound quality? Is powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) the most important? Would you rather have conveniences like automatic pausing? Sony consistently tops our list with its 1000X line. This is mostly due to the combination of sound quality, ANC performance and the truckload of features these headphones pack in. I\\u2019ll be the first to tell you that there are better sounding options and other companies, like Bose, offer more effective noise cancellation. But when you add everything up, no one comes close to the full slate of tools Sony puts in its premium headphone line. Exorbitant price tags don\\u2019t mean better audio quality. Bowers & Wilkins\\u2019 headphones are on the high end for wireless noise-canceling models and they sound amazing. However, Audio-Technica\\u2019s M50xBT2 is much more affordable and doesn\\u2019t have ANC, but these headphones have a warm, natural sound profile that I find very inviting. At the end of the day, it will come down to personal preference, but you don\\u2019t need to spend a lot to find great headphones.

I've been a contributing editor\\u00a0for PCMag since 2011. Before that, I was PCMag's lead audio analyst from 2006 to 2011. Even though I'm a freelancer now, PCMag has been my home for well over a decade, and audio gear reviews are still my primary focus. Prior to my career in reviewing tech, I worked as an audio engineer\\u2014my love of recording audio eventually led me to writing\\u00a0about\\u00a0audio\\u00a0gear. When people find out I've written more than 1,000 audio reviews for PCMag over the last 13 years, the first thing they usually want to know is which headphones are the best. But, to me, that's like asking what type of music is best. Sure, we all have favorites, but the category is too broad to break down so simply. The real question is, what are the right headphones for you? And to answer this, you have to consider your sound preferences, desire for extra features, and, of course, budget. With that in mind, we've gathered the absolute best headphones (and earphones) we've tested here, for a range of users and budgets. Read on for our top picks, followed by everything you need to know to find the perfect pair. *Deals are selected by our commerce team. Apple joins the true wireless noise-cancelling elite with the second-generation AirPods Pro\\u2014they are second only to Bose\\u2019s QuietComfort Earbuds II in this regard. Beyond this, they offer a rich audio experience, an innovative adaptive transparency mode, and excellent compatibility with Apple devices. First and foremost, the AirPods Pro are the best earphones for brand-loyal Apple users. No third-party competitor works as seamlessly across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The competition might be slowly catching up, but every new iteration in the Bose QC lineup, including the QuietComfort 45 headphones, manages to leap ahead of the crowd. In addition, we're big fans of this model's crisp, bass-forward sound and highly comfortable design. You can comfortably wear these headphones for long flights or other travel they pack away neatly into a suitcase or bag for storage. If you prefer something more compact, the Bose QC Earbuds II are an excellent alternative as long as you don't mind an in-ear design. Bose\\u2019s QuietComfort Earbuds II are at the top of the active noise cancellation class. They almost eliminate deep lows, plus they dial back mids and highs better than any other earphones we've tested. Additionally, they deliver an articulate, bass-forward sound that should please most listeners. If active noise cancellation in a true wireless design is your primary consideration, these Bose earbuds are unbeatable. Just keep in mind that the second-gen AirPods Pro make more sense for iPhone users. The on-ear Jabra Elite 45h headphones aren't new to the scene, but they are still relevant in a segment with dwindling choices. Highlights include a robust sound signature with deep bass, an exceptionally comfortable design, and a full-featured companion app with an EQ. If you prefer on-ear (or supra-aural) headphones, you don't have many new choices. Thankfully, Jabra's Elite 45h headphones succeed in all the most important categories we evaluate. They're also quite affordable. Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones keep the lineup's streak of excellence alive. They offer top-notch noise cancellation, a sophisticated look, a comfy fit, and among the best audio quality in the wireless realm. The capacitive touch panels on the outside of each earcup work intuitively, as well. Any Android users who want to take advantage of the hi-res-capable LDAC codec should put this Sony pair at the top of their list. They don't cancel distracting noise quite as effectively as the Bose QC 45 headphones, but that's a fair compromise if you care most about sound quality. Anker's Soundcore Space A40 earphones prove that you don't need to pay several hundred dollars for a quality experience. We're particularly fond of their detailed sound presentation, commendable noise cancellation, and secure fit. The companion app is another strong point because of its adjustable EQ. If you\\u2019re on a budget but don\\u2019t want to settle for subpar audio or noise cancellation, the Soundcore Space A40 earphones pack a lot of features for a sub-$100 price. The Urbanista Los Angeles headphones aren't quite competitive with class leaders in the audio or active noise cancellation departments, but they stand out for their ability to recharge via any light source. They represent a huge step forward for sustainability and we hope more products integrate this charging technology going forward. Charging your headphones doesn't significantly increase your carbon footprint, but these headphones can still help you make a small impact. And the convenience of not needing to ever recharge your headphones (if you expose them to light every other day or so) should surely appeal to people who aren't always near an outlet. In a segment that seems content with underwhelming IPX4 ratings, the JBL Reflect Aero noise-cancelling earphones impress with a top-notch IP68 rating, meaning they are fully dustproof and waterproof. They also offer a powerful sound signature and a quality companion app with a customizable EQ. If you want to listen to music on the beach or at the gym, the Reflect Aero earphones are up to the challenge. Feel free to get them dirty and then rinse them off as you see fit. The Momentum True Wireless 3 earphones look, feel, and sound like a luxury product. They don't cut back outside noise as effectively as top-end models from Apple and Bose, but their excellent audio experience makes them worth considering. Sennheiser has always put sound quality above all else in its products and these earbuds are no different. Furthermore, if you like to customize your listening experience, you should appreciate the ability to tweak the sound and on-ear controls to your preference. Earbuds do not seal off the ear canal and typically offer the worst audio performance of the bunch.\\u00a0Earphones\\u00a0seal off the ear canal and therefore offer better bass response, a more balanced stereo mix, and a more secure fit. On-ear headphones\\u00a0(which are also called supra-aural headphones) typically have smaller earcups that rest on the ear. Over-ear headphones (aka circumaural headphones) have larger earcups that rest around the ear. Over-ear headphones typically provide a more immersive experience than on-ear headphones, but this isn't a rule\\u2014plenty of on-ear models sound amazing, and can even offer a little bit of passive noise isolation with the use of well-cushioned earpads. The main reasons to consider one over the other are comfort (this varies from person to person) and portability (on-ear pairs are often smaller and more travel-friendly). Ever since Apple eliminated the headphone jack on the iPhone, wired headphones and earphones have faded from the forefront of this category in favor of\\u00a0Bluetooth models\\u00a0that require no cable at all. And true wireless headphones don't even have a wire connecting the two earpieces. Audiophiles probably still prefer a cable, particularly for home listening (and small cable adapters are available for iOS and Android devices with no headphone jack). If you prefer wired headphones, there are still lots of options available, but it's also worth noting that plenty of wireless headphones come with a cable that lets you use them in a passive mode. That use case doesn't drain the battery and gives you the best of both worlds. The sonic advantage of wired headphones is still quite significant, even if Bluetooth audio has improved dramatically in recent years. No matter how much better Bluetooth has gotten, it is still based on a lossy codec stream, making it inherently inferior to a wired audio connection. If sonics are important to you and you want to go wireless, make sure your headphones have the right high-end Bluetooth codecs that work with your phone, like LDAC and AAC, and don't simply use the lower-quality SBC codec. Our guide to Bluetooth codecs explains everything you need to know. Headphones most typically have dynamic drivers, whereas earphones might have dynamic drivers or balanced armature drivers. Especially in headphones, dynamic drivers are the most common, because a larger dynamic driver\\u2014which the ear enclosure for a pair of headphones can accommodate\\u2014can get louder and produce more bass depth. In earphones, the dynamic drivers have to be much smaller; this can often affect bass response. Many manufacturers, especially those in the business of making custom-molded in-ear monitors for musicians and engineers, turn to balanced armature drivers instead. Balanced armatures have the advantage of being tiny, which allows the earpieces to be smaller. Or, in the case of the aforementioned custom in-ear monitors, the earpieces can be quite large\\u2014freeing up room internally for several balanced armatures per ear, with each driver handling a specific frequency range. Generally speaking, it's possible to get excellent audio\\u2014or poor audio\\u2014from both dynamic and balanced armature drivers, although the two styles have dedicated fan bases. In both headphones and earphones, a somewhat new type is emerging, the planar magnetic driver. Pairs with those drivers are typically (much) more expensive. But the advantage of planar magnetic drivers is that they, ostensibly, produce a more precise sound because of the flat, larger-than-a-dynamic-driver film that vibrates between two magnets to create sound. Electrostatic speakers and headphones are similar to planar magnetic headphones in that they use a large, thin surface area to deliver the audio. But we see far fewer electrostatic headphones than any other type\\u2014they are typically through-the-roof expensive and best for home use. Noise cancellation\\u00a0used to be one of the most expensive features you could find in headphones, but we are seeing more and more (relatively) affordable options with this feature in both the headphone and earphone realms. Not only that, but the shift from wired to wireless headphones in terms of popularity has meant that most of the active noise cancellation (ANC) pairs we see are now wireless. That's excellent for convenience, but never assume that all ANC is the same. Simply put, the best of the ANC realm is quite effective, with Bose leading the category, but plenty of other manufacturers from Apple to Sony offer top-notch options. See how we test noise cancellation to understand how it works and how we test this feature. When ANC goes wrong, and it often does when you spend less than $200, there are three common characteristics. One, it's just not very effective\\u2014it doesn't tamp down low-frequency rumble like it should, or the overall reduction in surrounding noise isn't profound enough to make it compelling. Two, the ANC circuitry creates a faint hiss\\u2014not necessarily unpleasant, but certainly audible (similar to white noise or tape hiss). This is often to mask the fact that the ANC circuitry can't effectively tamp down some higher-frequency sounds. Third, lower-quality, wireless headphones often have ANC modes that unfortunately affect the sound signature. When we describe headphones with excellent noise cancellation, it's more or less the opposite\\u2014they squash the low frequencies effectively, tamp down surrounding chatter and typical environmental noises, and don't produce much of a high-frequency hiss (if any). The sound signature also shouldn't sound wildly different when this mode is active. Beyond that, several manufacturers, like Bose, offer apps that let you adjust the intensity of the noise cancellation mode or even which frequency range it should try to tackle. An increasing number of noise-cancelling headphones now include mics that power ambient listening modes. The point is to allow you to hear your surroundings as if you didn't have your headphones on, so you can talk to others without removing them. It's become a popular-enough feature that plenty of non-ANC pairs now have this feature too. Apple's adaptive transparency mode is one of the best implementations.

Aside from sometimes offering ambient mics for hearing your surroundings, exercise-focused headphones and earphones typically offer water-resistant builds, extra in-ear fit security accessories, and, in some cases, apps that help you monitor your workout. The most important feature of any exercise-focused headphones remains the IP rating. IP stands for ingress protection, and you often see ratings such as IPX7 or IP65. The first number represents protection against solids like dust (X acts as a placeholder, usually because the manufacturer didn't officially test against dust or solids), while the second number describes protection against fluids like water and sweat. For more, see our\\u00a0guide to IP ratings. As mentioned, another consideration is in-ear fit. We all have different ears, and some earphones fit better than others. If you've had trouble getting in-ears to stay in place in the past, consider a pair that comes with multiple eartips or earfins that sit against the ear to help add stability. It's also worth considering foam eartips (which sometimes ship with in-ears, but are less common than silicone) because they expand in the canal to create a stronger seal, much like earplugs. They also often have the benefit of increasing bass response. For more, see our picks for the best Bluetooth headphones for running and the best true wireless earbuds for running. Most wireless headphones now include a button that summons your phone's built-in voice assistant. But the next frontier is headphones that are always listening, like\\u00a0smart speakers. We've only tested a few thus far that can summon a voice assistant with a wake word or phrase (like \\\"Hey Siri\\\" or \\\"Alexa\\\"), but it seems the trend is likely to gain steam. Quality and performance can certainly cost money, though that isn't always the case and they aren't the only factors that dictate the price of headphones. Currently, certain technologies\\u2014true wireless and active noise cancellation are the two most obvious examples\\u2014tend to drive up the price. That doesn't mean you can't find affordable true wireless in-ears, but the higher-quality options tend to kick in around $150, while most excellent noise-canceling headphones start around $300. Iconic branding\\u2014think Apple, Beats, and Bose, to name a few\\u2014also impact pricing. In short, you can pay as little as\\u00a0$50 for good earphones or headphones and far more than $1,000 for\\u00a0audiophile models. Generally speaking, the range we see most quality options fall in is from $100 to $400. Plenty of strong in-ear, over-ear, and on-ear models are available in the $100 to $200 bracket, however.
