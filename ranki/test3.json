It folds flat, nice and compact in the equally sturdy case. There's USB-C support for charging, and it doesn't take too long to charge either -- but that's where the positives end. I'm a longtime fan of Sony headphones, but this pair is definitely my worst. Here's why: - The noise cancelling is really, really bad. I was patient and waited for Sony firmware updates, and while Sony did tweak some of the settings, none of the updates since June have done the headphones any good in terms of noise cancelling *quality*. Sure, the headphones can now automatically change noise cancelling intensity based on ... ",

The Sony WH-1000XM5s have amazing sound quality, a nice finish (the black does attract fingerprints, at least at first), very comfortable for extended wear, and easily adjustable. The only thing I wish would have been kept around is the ability to fold the headphones like the previous versions, the case for the XM5s is a bit bulky, but you can clip it to a backpack or slide it into a bag pretty easily. The case also holds an included USB-C charging cable and 3.5mm cable in a magnetically sealed compartment and covers the entirety ... ",

The headphone comes with sensors which detect if you have them on. It comes with an app where you can choose if to turn the headphones off when you take them off your head by using the sensor. This is amazing for saving batteries meaning you don't have to charge them often because you forgot to turn them off manually.

The main reason for purchasing them was for travelling, and making long-haul flights more enjoyable without the distraction of the plane and other background noises.

Firstly the aesthetics are very good, you receive them in a Sony blended material box that might be completely recycled but has a nice solid feel to it and looks nice. Then, when you open up inside is the carry case which may be a bit thicker than I'd like but I'm happy to live with it as it keeps the contents safe.

These headphones are definitely more comfortable to wear for longer periods in part because the of the shape of the earcups, but more so because of the improved feel of the soft leather padding around the earcups. They also appear to provide much better soundproofing from exterior noise as they fit closer to the shape of your face, and that's without switching on Noise Cancelling which is excellent. Putting the headphones onto your head is now so much easier with the sliding headband, no more clicky settings, they just fit first time and I found the band very comfortable, possibly more so than the 1000XM4's.

I switched to these recently after using and absolutely loving the QuietComfort 20 wired earbuds for many years. The comfort, fit audio, ANC and everything else about the QC20s were top notch. The Stayhear tips on the QC20s fit my ears so perfectly, that I figured these would be the same, just in wireless form. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The in-ear fit with these earbuds is slightly bulkier than the QC20s, and don't quite sit fully into the ear canal for me like the QC20s did. The touch features on the earbuds are nice, but I ended up turning off touch controls because I would activate the controls just trying to get these earbuds to fit securely in my ear every ... ",

There are 10 levels of noise cancellation, and you can define two custom presets to easily toggle between your favorite levels. This is in addition to two built-in levels, which are \"quiet\" (the max setting) and \"aware\" (the min setting). With cancellation at max, and some light music playing, the world completely drowns away. This exceeds the noise cancellation ability of my older, wired, Bose noise cancellation earbuds, which is impressive since these are wireless. The \"aware\" mode can be configured so that it auto adjusts the cancellation level based on ambient noise. I use this while push mowing my yard. When the mower is off, the cancellation is off, and I ... ",

So when I wanted to update to wireless earbuds, I figured I’d go with Bose again because of their outstanding quality and reliability. Sadly, my confidence in Bose has been severely shaken after purchasing these Quiet Comfort earbuds. Now, when they work they are pretty solid. I thought the sound was great, the noise cancelling worked well and the fit was fairly comfortable. Unfortunately, less than a week after purchasing them the left earbud went dead while I was on vacation and wouldn’t charge. I tried all of the trouble shooting tips, but nothing would work.

I work online, and I consistently have clients who cannot hear me well with this product, but can hear me perfectly on cheap sets (non bose headphones). Furthermore, there is a buzz in the headphones, that also existed in the previous set (as I had one set returned). I would not suggest this for phone calls. I also purchased these for working in the shop... anytime there is a sudden sound (saw blade, etc) there is a strong noise the headphones create (which I assume is it trying to balance the outside sound) but it is more piercing then the shop ... ",

Touch controls - cool concept but needs to be taken a step further. It's great having the ability to assign one short cut but that's not enough to offset the loss of the physical buttons from lower end models from Bose.

This is a nuisance. You can connect them to a device that doesn't have this app, but you can't then check the state of noise cancellation. Once you have a good feel for the noise cancellation state, you can change it by tapping the left bud.

I have now been using them for about 2-3 weeks everyday. No issues. I love that they have an aware and quiet mode to activate a preferred level of noise cancelling. Sometimes i just put them on just so I can have true silence. I actually never realised how much noise pollution I had near me until these. The actual sound quality is amazing as well. Very clear. I have smaller ears so I use the small attachments (they come with small, standard, and large)- I wish there was an option to buy or have an XS size however Ive never had any brand offer my perfect size so its not a problem at all. These are pretty close ... ",

This design is made for those that want a comfortable earbud that stays in. Additionally, they are more comfortable than my traditional, wrap around earbuds because the earbuds have an open umbrella shape and rest on the ear canal instead of narrower and resting inside the ear canal.

The WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are the newly released version from Sony and they have added even more user-friendly features and technology than the previous versions…and updated the look to a more modern design. What’s in the box - The headphones ship with a great zippered carrying case, a USB-C fast charging cable, an audio cable for wired connection and instructions/paperwork/360 Music offer. The headphones fold much easier compared to the previous versions. There is no more origami-like folding, just turn the ear cups and put them in the case…which is a good size for traveling. They fit ... ",

I have some top end wired Sony Hi Res headphones with no noise cancelling along with some competitors wired noise cancelling headphones and these beauties are on par if not better than both. Firstly the aesthetics are very good, you receive them in a Sony blended material box that might be completely recycled but has a nice solid feel to it and looks nice. Then, when you open up inside is the carry case which may be a bit thicker than I'd like but I'm happy to live with it as it keeps the contents safe. The first view of the WH-1000XM5 is impressive, nice matt finish with classy leather essentials that are very very comfortable ... ",

These headphones are definitely more comfortable to wear for longer periods in part because the of the shape of the earcups, but more so because of the improved feel of the soft leather padding around the earcups. They also appear to provide much better soundproofing from exterior noise as they fit closer to the shape of your face, and that's without switching on Noise Cancelling which is excellent. Putting the headphones onto your head is now so much easier with the sliding headband, no more clicky settings, they just fit first time and I found the band very comfortable, possibly more so than the 1000XM4's.

I’ve had them a couple of weeks and have used them most days, mainly in the evening but occasionally walking around doing things in the house - not used them outside. Mostly I’ve listened to music but I’ve heard a couple of podcasts too. The sound quality is lovely - the effects of tracks from Jean Michel Jarre where sound switches from one side to the other and back is reproduced brilliantly and the delicate background noises of trees rustling and goats on tracks recorded outside by Ballake Sissoko playing kora are fabulous.

I switched to these recently after using and absolutely loving the QuietComfort 20 wired earbuds for many years. The comfort, fit audio, ANC and everything else about the QC20s were top notch. The Stayhear tips on the QC20s fit my ears so perfectly, that I figured these would be the same, just in wireless form. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The in-ear fit with these earbuds is slightly bulkier than the QC20s, and don't quite sit fully into the ear canal for me like the QC20s did. The touch features on the earbuds are nice, but I ended up turning off touch controls because I would activate the controls just trying to get these earbuds to fit securely in my ear every ... ",

There are 10 levels of noise cancellation, and you can define two custom presets to easily toggle between your favorite levels. This is in addition to two built-in levels, which are \"quiet\" (the max setting) and \"aware\" (the min setting). With cancellation at max, and some light music playing, the world completely drowns away. This exceeds the noise cancellation ability of my older, wired, Bose noise cancellation earbuds, which is impressive since these are wireless. The \"aware\" mode can be configured so that it auto adjusts the cancellation level based on ambient noise. I use this while push mowing my yard. When the mower is off, the cancellation is off, and I ... ",

So when I wanted to update to wireless earbuds, I figured I’d go with Bose again because of their outstanding quality and reliability. Sadly, my confidence in Bose has been severely shaken after purchasing these Quiet Comfort earbuds. Now, when they work they are pretty solid. I thought the sound was great, the noise cancelling worked well and the fit was fairly comfortable. Unfortunately, less than a week after purchasing them the left earbud went dead while I was on vacation and wouldn’t charge. I tried all of the trouble shooting tips, but nothing would work.

Furthermore, there is a buzz in the headphones, that also existed in the previous set (as I had one set returned). I would not suggest this for phone calls.

This is a nuisance. You can connect them to a device that doesn't have this app, but you can't then check the state of noise cancellation. Once you have a good feel for the noise cancellation state, you can change it by tapping the left bud. But, if you don't have a good feel for how each state sounds, you need the Bose Music app. The audio is quite good, but not fabulous.

It folds flat, nice and compact in the equally sturdy case. There's USB-C support for charging, and it doesn't take too long to charge either -- but that's where the positives end. I'm a longtime fan of Sony headphones, but this pair is definitely my worst. Here's why: - The noise cancelling is really, really bad. I was patient and waited for Sony firmware updates, and while Sony did tweak some of the settings, none of the updates since June have done the headphones any good in terms of noise cancelling *quality*.

They also appear to provide much better soundproofing from exterior noise as they fit closer to the shape of your face, and that's without switching on Noise Cancelling which is excellent.

The positives however are that the connection is much easier to manage, the Sony's used to be a pain to get to sync to multiple devices, the AirPods Max are much better in that regard. I'm sure that's mostly the H1 chip and using Apple devices but it's so much more pleasant not to fight Bluetooth to get them to connect. The AirPods Max are clearly designed to emulate the experience of AirPods, they don't have a powerbutton and are meant to be put back in the case after use, and then when ... ",

They feel solid in your hands (and heavy on the head) but comfortable to wear (at least for me) for a few hours. Noise cancellation is better than my Sony XM4. Digital crown dial and secondary button does the trick to play, pause, and toggle ANC (Sony did spoil me with the tapping of headset to play/pause but it's fine) Spatial audio is mind blowing and the convenience to easily connect to any Apple device - including the Apple TV is how you're rewarded for being a part of their ecosystem.

I got these because they were on sale and my old pair of Sony WH-1000XM3 (which I loved) were failing, so I figured I would buy these and worst case exchange for Sony headphones if these weren't worth the premium.

These have really good specs that help: noise cancelling function, transparency mode (that modulates sudden loud noises and mutes them down for you, even if you had noise cancelling turned off), a really good microphone for calls etc, and an incredibly durable frame with replaceable parts. The biggest downside I have found is that condensation builds inside of the headset very quickly. The headphones are not water resistant in any way, so this is troublesome if you have to wear for any length of time.

All around, it is a beat of a product. You cannot go wrong with it. I own the XM5’s and comparing the two, the aipods max are more comfortable but the Sony XM5’s provide a deeper and louder bass. The sony XM5’s provide SLIGHTLY better noise canceling and should not be the overall deciding factor between the two. As far as sound quality, the airpods max takes the cake.

I used them wirelessly for conference calls; they can be wired as well with a lightning to aux cable.

Aside from the weight, the 9 microphones make these feel like you don't have them on - voices/outside sounds are that clear. If you wear glasses, these will hurt after a while from the pressure. After using these for a couple months (without glasses on), they don't hurt when I use them anymore. I guess I just have to position them a certain way where it doesn't make my head hurt.

They worked great for a couple weeks and then mysteriously developed a connection issue. They will pair with the AppleTV but lose connection every time you shift them on your ears.

I switched to these recently after using and absolutely loving the QuietComfort 20 wired earbuds for many years. The comfort, fit audio, ANC and everything else about the QC20s were top notch. The Stayhear tips on the QC20s fit my ears so perfectly, that I figured these would be the same, just in wireless form. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The in-ear fit with these earbuds is slightly bulkier than the QC20s, and don't quite sit fully into the ear canal for me like the QC20s did. The touch features on the earbuds are nice, but I ended up turning off touch controls because I would activate the controls just trying to get these earbuds to fit securely in my ear every ... ",

There are 10 levels of noise cancellation, and you can define two custom presets to easily toggle between your favorite levels. This is in addition to two built-in levels, which are \"quiet\" (the max setting) and \"aware\" (the min setting). With cancellation at max, and some light music playing, the world completely drowns away. This exceeds the noise cancellation ability of my older, wired, Bose noise cancellation earbuds, which is impressive since these are wireless. The \"aware\" mode can be configured so that it auto adjusts the cancellation level based on ambient noise. I use this while push mowing my yard. When the mower is off, the cancellation is off, and I ... ",

So when I wanted to update to wireless earbuds, I figured I’d go with Bose again because of their outstanding quality and reliability. Sadly, my confidence in Bose has been severely shaken after purchasing these Quiet Comfort earbuds. Now, when they work they are pretty solid. I thought the sound was great, the noise cancelling worked well and the fit was fairly comfortable. Unfortunately, less than a week after purchasing them the left earbud went dead while I was on vacation and wouldn’t charge. I tried all of the trouble shooting tips, but nothing would work.

Furthermore, there is a buzz in the headphones, that also existed in the previous set (as I had one set returned). I would not suggest this for phone calls.

Touch controls - cool concept but needs to be taken a step further.

This is a nuisance. You can connect them to a device that doesn't have this app, but you can't then check the state of noise cancellation. Once you have a good feel for the noise cancellation state, you can change it by tapping the left bud. But, if you don't have a good feel for how each state sounds, you need the Bose Music app. The audio is quite good, but not fabulous.

I have now been using them for about 2-3 weeks everyday. No issues. I love that they have an aware and quiet mode to activate a preferred level of noise cancelling. Sometimes i just put them on just so I can have true silence. I actually never realised how much noise pollution I had near me until these. The actual sound quality is amazing as well. Very clear.

Well these ones, are indeed noise cancelling to the point where you talk to your husband for a few minutes until you realize he was actually wearing these and he didn’t actually hear you. Many a times I have had to throw a pillow at him or to give him a nudge so I can get his attention. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ I tried these myself as he wanted to prove to me that they were indeed noise cancelling, and I hate that he is right.

This design is made for those that want a comfortable earbud that stays in. Additionally, they are more comfortable than my traditional, wrap around earbuds because the earbuds have an open umbrella shape and rest on the ear canal instead of narrower and resting inside the ear canal. That makes them much more comfortable than traditional wrap around ones for anything longer than short periods. The Bose QC ... ",

I have some top end wired Sony Hi Res headphones with no noise cancelling along with some competitors wired noise cancelling headphones and these beauties are on par if not better than both. Firstly the aesthetics are very good, you receive them in a Sony blended material box that might be completely recycled but has a nice solid feel to it and looks nice. Then, when you open up inside is the carry case which may be a bit thicker than I'd like but I'm happy to live with it as it keeps the contents safe. The first view of the WH-1000XM5 is impressive, nice matt finish with classy leather essentials that are very very comfortable ... ",

These headphones are definitely more comfortable to wear for longer periods in part because the of the shape of the earcups, but more so because of the improved feel of the soft leather padding around the earcups. They also appear to provide much better soundproofing from exterior noise as they fit closer to the shape of your face, and that's without switching on Noise Cancelling which is excellent. Putting the headphones onto your head is now so much easier with the sliding headband, no more clicky settings, they just fit first time and I found the band very comfortable, possibly more so than the 1000XM4's. As for the touch controls on the right ... ",

I’ve had them a couple of weeks and have used them most days, mainly in the evening but occasionally walking around doing things in the house - not used them outside. Mostly I’ve listened to music but I’ve heard a couple of podcasts too. The sound quality is lovely - the effects of tracks from Jean Michel Jarre where sound switches from one side to the other and back is reproduced brilliantly and the delicate background noises of trees rustling and goats on tracks recorded outside by Ballake Sissoko playing kora are fabulous.

Compared to the previous iterations of the Wh-1000x series, this generation does not fold into a more compact size. For my lifestyle. this was not an issue. However, if you travel frequently and would like to store these headphones inside a bag, I can attest to their bulk.

Micro-USB still though...wow, okay, I get it. Did I mention they appear to produce the same sound and tone? Battery life on Studio3s from 25-30 is way better than the 10-12 I get with my Studio2s I can't see anyone paying $349 regular price for these cans.

The major pain point of these headphones was the original price of $349.99. Having them for some time, I can definitely say they are not worth the original price, especially when the Sony WH-1000XM5s exist at that price. However, these are great for regular people, especially at a discount. The sound quality is more than good enough, and shines on bass heavy tracks as Beats aways has. The good thing is bass is no longer overpowered though. This was never an issue for me as I always use a bass boost EQ setting anyways. Sound is more balanced overall. These do tend to make your ears hot, not sweaty. If you’re looking to workout in them, definitely clean them after each use. ... ",

It smashes my glasses arms into my head and down on my ears. It’s just soreness after a mere couple of hours. I have a pair of gaming over ear headphones that feel comfortable, always, and never makes my ears hurt. I hear Sony makes comfortable headphones so I’m going to return these and try another brand.

I'm not an audiophile so I'm not a perfectionists about the preciseness of music, which I still think sounds very good on the Studio3's. They are light and don't feel overbearing on my head/ears.

The headphones are very comfortable but for a limited time (around 4 hours for me) before my ears start hurting a little bit. The best thing I can say about these headphones is the sound quality. The base, the mids, the treble all work together to make a really good sound. Its comfortable to wear on my head too. It does have some weight to it, but not heavy by any means. The packaging was also very nice and pleasant. Truly felt like I was opening some exclusive product. The battery life is pretty good as ... ",

Ape chip does make difference in usability if you have apple devices. Micro usb port to charge is worst solution for charging anything just because it is outdated to start with.

The positives however are that the connection is much easier to manage, the Sony's used to be a pain to get to sync to multiple devices, the AirPods Max are much better in that regard. I'm sure that's mostly the H1 chip and using Apple devices but it's so much more pleasant not to fight Bluetooth to get them to connect. The AirPods Max are clearly designed to emulate the experience of AirPods, they don't have a powerbutton and are meant to be put back in the case after use, and then when ... ",

Digital crown dial and secondary button does the trick to play, pause, and toggle ANC (Sony did spoil me with the tapping of headset to play/pause but it's fine) Spatial audio is mind blowing and the convenience to easily connect to any Apple device - including the Apple TV is how you're rewarded for being a part of their ecosystem.

I got these because they were on sale and my old pair of Sony WH-1000XM3 (which I loved) were failing, so I figured I would buy these and worst case exchange for Sony headphones if these weren't worth the premium.

These have really good specs that help: noise cancelling function, transparency mode (that modulates sudden loud noises and mutes them down for you, even if you had noise cancelling turned off), a really good microphone for calls etc, and an incredibly durable frame with replaceable parts. The biggest downside I have found is that condensation builds inside of the headset very quickly.

All around, it is a beat of a product. You cannot go wrong with it. I own the XM5’s and comparing the two, the aipods max are more comfortable but the Sony XM5’s provide a deeper and louder bass.

I used them wirelessly for conference calls; they can be wired as well with a lightning to aux cable.

Aside from the weight, the 9 microphones make these feel like you don't have them on - voices/outside sounds are that clear. If you wear glasses, these will hurt after a while from the pressure. After using these for a couple months (without glasses on), they don't hurt when I use them anymore. I guess I just have to position them a certain way where it doesn't make my head hurt.

They worked great for a couple weeks and then mysteriously developed a connection issue. They will pair with the AppleTV but lose connection every time you shift them on your ears.

I’d also throw in the 560S as well, still fairly new but I can definitely see it being considered a legendary headphone with time\n\nX2HR - great all rounder for music and gaming, built like an absolute tank, still baffles me how it manages to have such an open soundstage but retain closed back levels of bass thump\n\nM50x/M40x- love them or hate them, they’re responsible for getting so many people into audio and they definitely deserve a spot on the list just for the sheer impact they’ve had",

Needs a couple of mods to fix some of its glaring flaws (mainly comfort).  Don't need PEQ for this.  Comfort is nothing to write home about.  If you can snag these on the used market, they're quite a capable set.\n\nHifiman HE-400 - the cheaper HE-500 route if you use PEQ properly (akin to an Elex for the Focal Clear).  Comfort is not something to write home about either.  Between the HE-400i and this, I prefer the midrange texture of the HE-400 (when EQ'd).\n\nSennheiser HD800 - excellent technicalities and most comfortable to my head shape and size.

I can’t think of another headphone where you get as much for $200. \n\nKoss ESP/95X - Best bang-for-the buck introduction to electrostatics by far, and a meatier sound signature than the entry-level STAX options.  \n\nAudeze LCD-4 - Just absolutely high-end and luxury in every way.

                "transcript": "right so i've recently decided that i need to get better at focusing and so obviously a pair of noise cancelling headphones is the way to guarantee this and so in this video we're going to be testing these top six noise cancelling headphones to figure out which of these is the best on the market and which of these i am going to buy for myself now the cool thing is we actually have a whole range of these in different price points we have the ridiculously cheap anchor sound cores we have the microsoft surface headphone 2. we have the sony wh xm 1000 m4 or something like that we have the bose qc700s we have the apple airport max and we have the stupidly expensive b and o b o plate h95 and so for each of these what we did is that i tested them extensively myself and we got a few team members to test them all as well and we're going to rate them all in terms of aesthetics in terms of fit and comfort in terms of noise cancellation and in terms of sound quality for music now as you know i'm a fan of upfront conclusions so i'm just going to come out and say that the ones i'll be getting are the sony wh mx4s whatever they're called if you're on a budget the anker sound cores are actually surprisingly reasonable and if you don't care about long-term comfort and are happy to spend a bit more money the apple airpods maxes are the choice for you so if that's all you wanted from the video then thank you very much for watching and do please have a great rest of day but now we're going to go over these one at a time and i'm going to share the pros and the cons of each of these six pairs of headphones and i'll show the results of my personal and our team testing about the various factors so that whichever one of these you're buying you can make hopefully a slightly more informed decision about the noise canceling headphones that are obviously going to change your life so we're going to start with the cheapest ones and these are the anker soundcore q30s which retail for about 100 and if you're on a budget these are actually a really good option and probably the best value for money that you can get in terms of the noise cancellation headphone wireless headphone market their design is a little bit plasticky and flimsy and they come with this sound core case thing which again is nothing to write home about it's got these little cheapy cheap looking pieces of foam in it as well but to be honest for the price it's not bad at all in terms of fit and comfort it's actually pretty reasonable in terms of looks these did get the lowest rating from our team members and from me with most of us rating it either a one or two for an average rating of 1.5 stars in terms of looks but in terms of fit and comfort they're actually pretty reasonable and most of us rated them a four or three so this got a rating of 3.5 in terms of fit and comfort now when it comes to noise cancellation i'm gonna be honest like i tested these fairly extensively and i didn't really notice much of a difference between the noise cancelling capabilities of the different headphones in fairness we are in this fairly quiet environment if i was in an airplane or on a train or in the london underground maybe the noise cancelling test would have been better but as far as i could really tell they were all fairly similar in terms of noise cancelling ability but in terms of sound quality there were some noticeable differences between the six headphones in the lineup the sound is pretty good but i'm not like wowed by it i'm still getting that kind of like cheap feel and these ones clocked in fairly reasonably with an average rating of 3.75 stars across our team the battery life on these is absolutely incredible it's 40 hours apparently with noise cancelling and 60 hours if you turn off the noise cancelling and they've got a few buttons on the bottom where you can increase the volume or decrease the volume or hit play and pause again these are nothing to write home about but if for example you're a student and you're on a budget and you do want a pair of noise cancelling headphones to make it easier to focus when you're working or if you're in a coffee shop or whatever then these are by far the best value for money and they also fall down nicely and can go kind of go into this case and you can shove this little piece of plastic in there somewhere if you really want to but yeah fairly reasonable option if you are on a budget moving up a little bit in terms of price point we now have the microsoft surface headphones too which retail for around about 270 dollars now in terms of aesthetics i actually quite like these especially because they're this sort of silvery whitey kind of color and i'm a fan of things that look white broadly and they have these interesting features in that on both knobs you can like turn the knobs so one of the knobs is full volume and the other knob is for the noise cancellation ability of the headphones allegedly they have multi-device support and so they can connect to two devices at once and allegedly it can switch between your iphone and your macbook if it recognizes you're getting a phone call in practice this feature does not work like it has never once actually worked as intended for me and in terms of battery life it's fairly low it's got around about 18 hours of battery life which means you do have to charge it somewhat regularly if you're going to be using it extensively for long work sessions in terms of aesthetics i gave this a five star rating but some of the team gave it a three and four star so the average rating of this was four stars and in terms of fit and comfort it's actually very reasonable i've got fives and fours across the board with an average rating of 4.3 stars but sadly in terms of sound quality these are just not as good as some of the alternatives so i gave this personally a three out of five in terms of sound quality which was kind of what the team thought as well so this had an average rating of 3.3 stars in terms of music quality so i actually used to use these for about six months in 2021 and i really liked them mostly because of the aesthetic they were quite nice to be honest i hadn't a b tested them with a bunch of different headphones to be honest all these review videos are somewhat artificial because once you have one of these headphones it doesn't really matter which one you have you kind of then just get used to it and that becomes the new normal it's only when you really compare them side by side with like kind of six other headphones that you start to quibble about things like noise quality but broadly i was a big fan of them um when i had them and i like the fact that they came with this nice little case which meant i could just chuck it in my bag and the case had a nice little slot for the cables as well then sadly my tesla got broken into and these got stolen so this is just a pair that we ordered for review purposes but after testing them side by side with all the others i've decided that i'm no longer going to be using the microsoft surface headphones too because the sonys are just a little bit better than them across all fronts except the aesthetics anyway that brings us on to the sony what are they called the sony wh-1000xm4s this is the only real problem with these is that it's impossible to remember what the name is sony really needs to come up with a better way of naming these headphones but they are the ones that i'm going to be now switching to because i think they're the perfect mix of comfort and sound quality and noise cancellation and battery life even if the aesthetic is just slightly less nice than the microsoft surface headphones too now in terms of fit and comfort these actually were the best headphones that we tested they were the most comfortable buy a reasonable margin decent very comfortable most comfortable yet and i think the main reason for that is that these are just so light they are i think probably the lightest out of the six headphones that we've tested although i haven't measured it just on my head they feel really light and when it comes to wearing these for extended periods of time really the comfort correlates strongly with how heavy the headphones are or rather how light the headphones are because the main problem with the airpods max for example like they're amazing in sound quality they're amazing in battery life they're amazing across all fronts it's just that they're really heavy and after like an hour of using them my head starts to hurt from having such heavy headphones on it and so the fact that the sony's are so comfortable to wear for very extended periods of time i think it's mostly down to just how light they are in terms of looks yeah they're not bad the team thought they were five stars and four stars in terms of looks i'd personally rate them a three star because i do prefer the look of the microsoft surface headphones but i mean they're very reasonable they look like just a normal pair of noise cancelling headphones nothing to write home about and in terms of design they fold up nicely like this so it's very easy to pack into a bag and they also come with this little carry case that if you want you can put them in i'm probably not going to do that because that's too much faff i'm just probably going to stick them in my bag exactly like that they charge like all these do by usbc that's pretty standard and unsurprisingly they've got a power button and a button that lets you control the level of noise cancellation in terms of battery life these are actually really good they're advertised as having 30 hours of battery life with the noise cancellation and 38 hours without noise cancellation if you're not into noise cancellation for whatever reason and in terms of sound quality for listening to music i personally thought these were really good i gave them a four star rating sadly this was not mirrored by our team who thought they were more like two stars and three stars in terms of noise quality and so the overall rating for this in terms of sound quality is 3.5 stars but personally i think that's a little bit of an under estimate of what's the actual i say actual my my personal subjective interpretation of their their music quality was and to be honest this sort of subjectiveness you get a lot when it comes to testing headphones like i'm not an audiophile no one in our team is really an audiophile and so we don't objectively know what these headphones sound like all we can say is what our subjective experience like oh this sounds a bit better than that and after doing a bunch of hot swapping to be like are these really sounding better than the surface are these really sounding better than the boses i kind of decided at the end that like yeah whenever i put these on my head i felt ah these are so comfortable and i also felt that oh the sound quality on these is pretty good yeah not as good as the airpods max airplanes backs max wins across the board just blew everyone else out of the water in terms of sound quality but i don't think that trade-off is warranted given how heavy they are and therefore how uncomfortable they are for long periods of time at least for me and so the sony's are the ones that i'm going to be holding on to i haven't figured out whether i want them in white or silver or in blue i'm not too much of a fan of this matte black color but hey they're really good and these are now going to be a staple part of my everyday carry all right now we're spending a little bit more money and we come to the bose qc 700s which retail for 350 but these are a little bit more expensive than the sony's and actually i think the main selling point is the look it does look quite nice um our team was a bit uh split on whether we liked this particular style with these like yeah it's just a slightly different design to most noise cancelling headphones i personally quite like them but in terms of comfort they're not quite as good as the sony's and in terms of sound quality for me also they're not quite as good as the sony's our team rated these pretty poorly across the board so this got an average of 3.25 stars when it came to fit and comfort it got a three stars in terms of noise cancellation and it got a 3.1 stars in terms of sound quality and a 3.2 stars in terms of look so like broadly if we averaged the four four five four four team members that we had testing these broadly we weren't a fan these are actually the ones i've been using for the last six months since my tesla got broken into and i lost my microsoft surface headphones too i've actually been using these but i'm going to give them away to a friend and instead replace them with the sony's because the sony's are marginally better in terms of comfort and in terms of sound quality next we come to the apple airpod maxes which are really expensive and retail for around about 640 dollars at least if you convert the pounds we'll put the actual dollar price over here now these come with the case but we have two team members gordon angus in our studio who use these and they never carry the case with them similarly when i used to use the apple airpods max i never carry the case because the case is totally pointless and genuinely these are really good the sound quality is just way better than all of the other headphones that we tested and when you put these on you immediately think oh my god this sounds incredible compared to the other noise cancelling headphones and anyway it kind of screws up your mind a bit or your ear rather because it makes you think that the others sound bad in comparison to this but then after a while of getting used to the others you stop you you kind of forget what it was like to wear the apple airpods max this is probably the best sounding of them all the sound is amazing the design is a bit polarizing i quite like the blue color personally rather than the black and they've got this little mesh thing at the top which is kind of comfortable but the main thing the main drawback of these as i've said is that they're just too heavy they're very comfortable for short amounts of time but for more than about half an hour i started to find my kind of ears getting a bit tired my head getting a bit tired maybe i'm not hench enough to handle these but i just i just really wasn't a fan in terms of long-term comfort levels now if you have apple devices these are actually really good because there is a chip or something inside them that makes them pair with iphones and macs really easily so you can literally just wear them and they will automatically pair to your iphone or to your mac and really that means that there isn't actually a way of turning them off the way they go into standby mode is when you put them in the case but given that realistically no one really carries the case around because it's kind of useless it does have that slight quirk to them it's got a little button at the top which acts as a little sort of volume dial and also if you press the button down you can access siri but the issue is that these are the only phones that don't have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack so if you listen to stuff on airplanes a lot and you want to plug your headphones into the aeroplane system thingy so that you can watch a movie on the aeroplane using your fancy noise canceling headphones you can do that with all the others but you can't do it with the apple airpods max this is not a huge problem like to be honest these were the clear winners in most of the categories in terms of comfort so yeah great pair of headphones super expensive but you do get fantastic sound quality for that but they are not for me because i just can't handle them in terms of the heaviness and the discomfort and finally we come to the big daddies the b o b o play h95s which are ridiculously expensive these come in at 940 or thereabouts and they have they have these like leather thingies around them i think you can actually take these off yeah you can take them off they have leather around them they have this leather thing at the top so it's like a more premium higher end feel to these noise canceling headphones but sadly they are just not very good in terms of the aesthetics our team was a bit split on them i quite like these metal bits and i would have even liked the nordic ice color because these come in a multitude of colors and that color looks really cool but again they run into into the same issue that the airpods max do in that they are quite heavy and so wearing them for extended periods of time can actually get a little bit uncomfortable sound quality as well again it's reasonable most of our team rated them somewhere between three and four stars i would just thought that the sound would be better for this price so the sound quality doesn't feel amazing i thought these were a three star personally i did personally prefer the sound quality of the sony's despite the fact that these are like triple the price but i guess what you're really paying for here is the sort of more premium leather feel of the noise cancelling headphones and to be honest i liked the nordic ice color at least on the website so much that if these were slightly lighter i probably would have gone for these just to have the flecks of like having a really nicely aesthetic pair of headphones sadly they're not comfortable enough to even warrant that so basically i'm not a fan of these despite them being quite expensive and quite high-end oh the other cool thing about them is that they do come in this fancy like metal case thing which feels feels very high-end feels very premium makes you think feel healed oh sick but it's also a case that's quite heavy by itself and so it's not a case that you're really going to be carrying in a backpack it's more for the kind of aesthetics of the unboxing experience and so that you can feel oh i'm a legend because i wear bang olufsen noise canceling headphones now in terms of practical uses of these noise canceling headphones there's three main domains that have made up the bulk of my use of these over the last few years firstly it's listening to my study with me playlist on spotify while i'm trying to work or focus or do any kind of deep work at all second it's consuming things like music and podcast and audiobooks while i'm on things like trains and airplanes because the noise canceling is really helpful and thirdly i find these noise canceling headphones really helpful if i'm editing videos because then with the noise cancelling i can edit videos wherever i go and speaking of editing videos another tool that i find incredibly helpful is called storyblocks who are very kindly sponsoring this video i've been using storyblocks since i started this youtube channel five years ago in 2017. droidblocks is absolutely fantastic it is a subscription service that gives you royalty-free stock photos and stock videos and stock music that you can use in youtube videos just like this one in fact when we got team members to test out the headphones some of the tracks we were using were from storyblocks royalty free so that we can include them in this video without getting copyright stricken for them me and our editors personally find storyblocks super helpful when we're trying to find b-roll and especially in the early days of this youtube channel when i was trying to juggle making videos with the demands of being a medical student and later the demands of being a doctor it was super helpful to have this library of high quality stock footage available to use as b-roll so that i didn't necessarily have to go out and spend hours and hours shooting my own b-roll for all the videos that i was making and other than just videos and music storyblocks also has things like after effect templates and premiere pro templates for titles lower thirds transitions and even sound effects that you can incorporate into your videos whenever you want storyblocks has subscriptions for any budget and so if you want to check it out then do hit the link in the video description so thank you so much storyblocks for sponsoring this video and for helping out the channel over the last five years so overall when it comes to these headphones the budget pick is the anker sound cores which are very reasonable my personal pick is the sony wh mx1000 xm4s or whatever they're called and if you don't care about the comfort thing the airpods maxes are by far the best ones in terms of sound quality if you like this video you might be interested in what sort of podcasts i listen to with my fancy pair of noise cancelling headphones and that'll be in a video over there called 20 podcasts that made me millionaire so thank you so much for watching and i'll see you in the next video bye "

                "transcript": "while true wireless earbuds have dominated the headphones landscape the last few years there are plenty of people who still like the full size variety and that's why I put together this Roundup of the best wireless noise canceling over-ear headphones of 2022. that'll be clear these are headphones that were released in 2022 and I haven't included any models that came out in years past I've narrowed it down to my five favorites with an additional affordable pick thrown in because when you get into these top wireless headphones well they tend to be rather expensive and a lot of people just can't afford them but we're talking about the best of the best so here we go here are my picks from highest to lowest price [Music] at 799 we have the focal bathies focal is a French Audio company known for its high-end speakers and wired headphones some of which cost thousands of dollars it's finally done with a lot of high-end audio companies have had to do in this age of on-the-go Wireless music listening make active noise canceling Bluetooth headphones but they also have a built-in DAC that stands for digital to analog converter for USB wirelessening with any computer smartphone or tablet with USBC and that makes it easy to go from Wireless to wirelessening for slightly better sound the bathys build quality and design are excellent they're comfortable to wear and they're easily one of the best sounding wireless headphones they offer excellent Clarity detail accuracy and Powerful well-defined bass that's got the right amount of warp to it they have a spacious Sound Stage for closed back headphones anyway and they allow you to hear each instrument distinctly in complicated tracks where several instruments are playing at the same time the bathies use aluminum magnesium speaker drivers while focals higher end wired headphones have beryllium drivers that offer even more clarity and accuracy with the right setup their noise canceling isn't as strong or as good as what you get with the Sony wh-1000 Xbox 5 or the Bose quiet Comfort 45 headphones for example but focal has done its best to implement noise canceling without sacrificing sound quality which is always a challenge they're also good for making calls so a really great headphone overall but out of most people's price range though it is cheaper than the mark Levinson number 5909 headphones that go for around a thousand bucks okay moving on to the Bowers and Wilkins px8 at 699 when they originally announced the Swanky px8 were supposed to cost 549 for essentially the same price as Apple's airpods max headphones however when they finally hit stores the px8s price jumped to 6.99 or a full 300 more than the company stepped down px7 Series 2 headphones which are also excellent the biggest difference between the px8 and the px7 S2 are the px8s all new 40 millimeter carbon cone drive units that are inspired by the carbon Dome drive units used in the company's 700 series loudspeaker line Bowers and Wilkins says these units help deliver Superior resolution detail and timing with even more accurate sound than the px7s II based on my test that's true I like the px7s2 the px8 headphones do sound more special with the touch more openness and overall Clarity the right near the top for sound in a Bluetooth headphone and are also comfortable to wear for long listening sessions for the best sound you can listen to lossless files on a computer in wired mode with a USBC to USBC cable as for the noise canceling function it's good but not quite on par with what you get with the Sony wh-1000x Mark V and while the voice calling capabilities are solid these don't reduce background noise quite as well as some headphones like the Sony when you're on calls however the transparency mode is Top Notch while I can't say they're worth 300 more than the px7 S2 they're a great set of cans if you can afford them I do prefer the sound and overall performance with a more expensive focal bathies that the bathies don't have such strong noise canceling but the px8 are a close second at 5.99 we have the master of dynamic mw75 headphones the company's best headphones to date a last metal construction adds weight but that's a trade-off some people don't mind the mw75 sound excellent with clean accurate sound natural sounding mids and nice treble detail the base is tight and Punchy with just enough warmth the mw75 seem well suited for all types of music genres and I had no trouble wearing the headphones for longer listening sessions though I would have liked the ear pads to be slightly larger I thought they measured up well against the Apple airpods Max for sound quality the mw75 came across as the more accurate natural sounding headphones the airpods max had a little more energy and played a little louder but the mw75 sounded a bit smoother and a tad more articulate it's also worth noting that while the mw75 don't have quite the noise canceling capabilities of the Sony wh-1000x Mark V they do offer very good noise canceling and are also very good for making calls another great headphone overall speaking of the Sony that's the next headphone on this list it's 400 though it's been discounted lately to around 350 this is the headphone that's going to hit the sweet spot for a lot of people it's relatively lightweight and comfortable sounds really good and offers top-notch noise canceling and noise reduction during voice calls Some people prefer the dual hinge design at the earlier 1000x mark IV which offers a little more bass energy but I personally prefer the slightly more refined sound of the Mark V and particularly appreciated the improvements to the call Quality well the Sony doesn't sound quite as good as the models I've already talked about it does have some nice extra features like Sony speak to chat mode and it does cost less and has Best in Class noise canceling at number five I have sennheiser's momentum for wireless a 350 headphone that's been selling for closer to 300 while some people may be a little disappointed that their design has become a bit too straightforward and less distinctive with less premium materials than the previous momentum three they essentially check all the boxes for what you want in a premium noise canceling headphone from the standpoint of comfort features and performance initially I wasn't wowed by them but after I broke them in for a few days their sound grew on me and Sennheiser has improved not only their noise canceling performance but also their voice calling performance and unlike the previous momentum 3 they do fold flat and have incredible battery life at up to 60 hours depending on what I was listening to there were times when I thought they did sound slightly better than the Sony's they're just a tad more natural and accurate sounding and they do cost less than the Sony so that's another reason to consider them last but not least I have my value pick the sound core by anchor space Q45 which is currently selling for around 130 if you can afford Sony's 1000x Mark V or the similarly named Bose qc45 yes there's a bit of copying going on here the space Q45 is a good alternative it's comfortable to wear with nicely padded ear cups and a dual hinge folding design sound quality is very good and the headphones offer better noise canceling than the step down Q35 as well as multi-point Bluetooth pairing and they do support the ldac audio codec for streaming high resolution music tracks over Bluetooth if you have a device that supports ldac many Android phones do although Samsung's Galaxy phones don't battery life is also very good at up to 50 hours with noise canceling on to be clear this headphone isn't up to level of the other headphones in this Roundup but it's Anchor's best sounding noise canceling headphone to date and a good value relatively speaking so that's it those are my top over ear wireless headphones of 2022 if you want more info about any of these products we've got links to all of them in the description below along with any full reviews I've done on CNET if you've got a favorite headphone yourself feel

in audiobooks the headphones here will present them at their very best thanks to the large powerful drivers and impressively large and detail Sound Stage they're comfortable for long periods and many boost additional features such as active noise cancellation and integrated Voice assistance for more enjoyable travels and effortless operation why over ear headphones because while earbuds are great too you can't fight the laws of physics good sound is always about moving air and no headphones moves air as well as a good pair of over ears if you've got high-res audio files and equipment and you don't have a pair of the best headphones you're missing out on some of the sheer musical Joy they deliver we have listed the top 5 over-ear headphones and their key features plus the things you need to consider to help you choose the best one for you link to all the products mentioned the video are in the description below you can also find a more detailed analysis and Echo price and tools on our website guidinggear.com foreign [Applause] [Music] number five anchor soundcore life q30 premium noise canceling headphones tend to cost more than 300 but what if you're on a tight budget what's your best option for noise canceling over here at phones as far as sound Comfort level and build quality you'd be hard-pressed to do better than the Ankara soundcore live q30 for the money they don't quite have the same Clarity or base definition as some of the top premium models but they're less than a third of the price and gets you about 75 of the way there in terms of sound it's well balanced overall with Punchy bass and there's an app that allows you to tweak the sound the noise canceling is good for the price though not up to the level of the Sony wh-1000xm5 or boy's Nest canceling headphones to 700s battery life is rated at an impressive 40 hours with USBC charging the only area where the q30 headphones fall a little short is voice calls they pick up your voice fine in quite environments but they just don't reduce background noise all that well compared to the step down q20 the q30 headphones do offer improved sound and a more premium design number four Audio Technica ADH m50xvt2 Audio Technica knows how to make a main headset with a killer value and the Audio Technica ADH m50xbt is a solid example of that this is the wireless version of the grid ADH m50x and it simply extends on the capabilities of that headset you'll still find powerful 45 millimeter neodymium drivers offering up to 15 to 28 000 hertz frequency response range for deep bass and Chris turbo 38 ohm impedance will also let you drive them over a wired connection with just about any device you have handy the wireless performance is also set to impress using Bluetooth 5.0 the headset is able to offer a 50r runtime the headset also supports ldac and AAC high quality audio codecs it also includes dual microphone to pick up your voice for calls and there are simple on-ear controls for media playback and calling of Alexa Google assistant or Siri Audio Technica even includes a carrying pouch to keep them secure when you're on the go number three Apple airpods Max yes they're expensive yes they come with an ugly arguably pointless case and yes their packaging omits an audio cable and wall charger yet they make their place in our video as one of the best over-ear headphones on the market why because for Apple Fans they're quite simply the best performing wireless headphones you can buy and not by small margin in fact their authenticity detail crispness and spaciousness Elevate their audio quality so far above the other products best in the wireless noise canceling class that the comparison starts to become a little redundant and you instant begin to consider them alongside proper Hi-Fi products unsurprisingly you do need an iPhone or iPad in order to get the best of the airpods max they will work with non-apple products using standard Bluetooth 5.0 but you'll miss out on many other unique features such as spatial audio and Siri wise control there's no denying that they cost a lot more than typical products in this class but the sound quality is King we think they're worth it number two Bose noise canceling headphone 700s when it comes to comfort the Bose noise canceling headphones 700 is the best option although they're 399.95 price one is on the Steep end the previous ergonomic nature and exceptional sound quality still made them one of our standout picks the foam lining within the headband and ear cuffs is designed with especially comfortable layers of memory foam cushioning it produces virtually zero pressure to the point it's almost like wearing nothing the Bose 700s are capable of ample extension on the ear cups allowing these to fit heads of almost any size for those who love portability though the ear cups don't fold in and while both does include a carrying case you'll have to settle for their unfolded size the Bose headphones don't skimp on sound or noise canceling either in fact Discord just below the Sony wh-1000xm5 in both categories we found that the Sound Stage and the compression quality were similar in those of Sony's cans both headphones offered a clear piano saxophone and drums on our testing track Jazz crowns by Joshua Redman and while the sound wasn't quite as crisp and the bass wasn't quite as intense as the Sony cans we were still impressed with what they could put out listening to might be right by a white Reaper the drums and vocals didn't come through with quite as much definition as they did on the Sony headphones they're based on Bad Guy by Billy eilish is also a small step down in depth intensity despite these minor shortcomings you're still getting a balanced mix that's very enjoyable if you're someone who likes to customize the experience via companion app you won't find that with the bills the app itself is quite bare notably lacking an equalizer feature it's a letdown especially at this price point so if you're looking to boost the bass or vocals you simply can't the app's primary use is toggling noise cancellation and transparency mode that being said these modes Excel on the Bose 700 transparency mode is especially cool as it amplifies surrounding sound so you can hear better inversely when you're on a phone call the microphones do a double duty by lowering environmental noise and amplifying your voice there is no customization to modify this feature in the end the bill 700s deliver a build that's unmatched in Comfort they feature a seamless modern design which unless you're on a ninja Mission could do with a pop of color from silver or white and gold varieties you also won't be disappointed with a balanced sound experience and ample battery life just know that for 399.99 you're paying for premium comfort number one Sony wh-1000xm5 the Sony over your ENC headphones take their predecessor's place as the best headphones money can buy at the moment even if they cost more money than the previous iterations in the lineup whether you like the new lighter design which can no longer be folded up or not they really are comfortable and the user-friendly perks are impossible to ignore whether it is reliably recognizing when the headphones have been removed from your head and pausing your music noting you're having a conversation and dialing down the volume or switching off noise canceling features when you're out on a busy road the Sony wh-1000xm5 headphones can anticipate exactly what you want to do without you needing to touch a button yourself these smart features feel snappier and more responsive than the previous versions and the noise cancellation and sound quality remains unbeatable at the level we like these headphones a lot and we think that they're the best wireless buy for the vast majority of people let us know in the comments which model Works 3 the best and why thank you for watching the video and that is all for this one if you find this video helpful in any way give a huge thumbs up stay tuned for the upcoming videos by subscribing to our Channel hope to see in the next video till next time see you guys later [Music] "

What works for some people doesn’t work for others, and few product categories are as diverse as headphones. In-ears, on-ears, over-ears—there’s just so much to choose from, and it’s hard to tell what’s right for you. Editor’s note: This list was updated on March 10, 2023 to include the Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless as a top pick, and the Beyerdynamic DT 900 PRO X, Google Pixel Buds A-Series, Grado SR80x, Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, Sennheiser HD 660S2, and Shure SE215 in the Notable mentions, add isolation and frequency response charts for the AKG K371, and to update formatting. For our top five picks, you can find the isolation and frequency response charts at the end of each image gallery. You can learn more about how to read our charts here. Why is the Sony WH-1000XM5 the best pair of noise cancelling headphones? Now that Sony has released the Sony WH-1000XM5, it takes the crown as the best active noise cancelling (ANC) headphones. This new model outperforms its closest competitors in noise attenuation and microphone quality. The default frequency response is a bit bassier than what we typically recommend, but you can easily equalize this from the Sony Headphones Connect app (iOS/Android) or your preferred third-party equalizer. To see frequency response and isolation charts for any of our top picks, scroll to the end of each photo gallery. The WH-1000XM5 offers top-of-the-line specs and features, including a custom equalizer, Sony’s 360 Reality Audio, and auto-pause/play sensors. The Sony WH-1000MX5 includes speak-to-chat, which pauses your media when you are speaking to someone and resumes playback 30 seconds after so you don’t miss the person’s response. You also have Bluetooth multipoint which is a great productivity feature for those who like to keep an ear on their phone while connected to their laptop. The microphone system is among the best we’ve seen in a headset like this and cancels out background noise effectively no matter the conditions. Take a listen to two of our microphone demos below! Sony WH-1000XM5 mic demo (Ideal): Sony WH-1000XM5 mic demo (Wind): If the price tag of the WH-1000XM5 is just a bit too high, you also can’t go wrong with the older Sony WH-1000XM4, which was previously our pick for best noise cancelling headphones. When comparing the Sony WH-1000XM5 to the WH-1000XM4, it’s clear that these headphones are closely related. Even though the XM5 model has better ANC and sound quality to boot, the Sony WH-1000XM4 is still worth getting if you don’t want to spend as much money. The fourth-generation headset shares many of the premium features found on the WH-1000XM5 and you can expect the older model to go on sale. If you want a budget alternative, the Sony WH-XB910N is a solid ANC headset if you can find it. However, you’ll only save $100, as the price tag is most often around $250. The fact of the matter is that good ANC is tough to get at a good price, and Sony currently has the best. The Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) is the best set of wireless earbuds for iPhone owners True wireless earphones took the market by storm after being dominated by the Apple AirPods for so long. Now there’s plenty of competition, much of which offers a more compelling experience than most of Apple’s audio products. However, with the company’s latest release, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) is back on top of the pole for iOS users. These buds offer great ANC, sound quality to match, and sound better than the AirPods (3rd generation) simply by virtue of the fact that they can seal your ear canal. These earbuds bring a big improvement to ANC and battery life, and the retain the same IPX4 rating, which now also covers the charging case. Speaking of the charging case, that’s where a lot of the more notable changes come. The AirPods Pro (2nd generation) charging case features Apple’s new U1 chip, which makes it compatible with Apple’s Find My service and the new integrated speakers will emit a noise to help you find it. Much like all the other AirPods, this is best used with Apple devices. It only supports SBC and AAC Bluetooth codecs, so there’s no high quality codec for android users. Also, many of the earbuds software features are found in the iOS settings app, so you’ll miss out on other platforms in that respect too. Still, this is about as good as it gets for wireless earbuds for Apple users. The AirPods Pro mic sounds best in quiet environments but can filter out some background noise. Listen to our samples below. AirPods Pro (2nd generation) microphone demo (Ideal): AirPods Pro (2nd generation) microphone demo (Office): AirPods Pro (2nd generation) microphone demo (Street): How does the microphone sound to you? Don’t lose pace with the Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless Sennheiser combines most of what you want in a great set of over-ear Bluetooth headphones in the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless. With support for a variety of high quality codecs like AAC, aptX, aptX HD, and aptX Adaptive, plus a 3.5mm headphone jack and USB-C listening, you’ll hardly ever get caught without a connection. You even get Bluetooth multipoint. More to the point, a stellar 56 hours and 21 minutes of battery life (with ANC on) outperforms most headphones. While the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless doesn’t beat out the Sony WH-1000XM5 on noise cancelling, the ANC onboard is still rather effective and adjustable. That sound experts at Sennheiser tune the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless to sound frankly great, is unsurprising. It gets very close to our target curve with just a bit more bass. However, if that sound is not your preference, you can utilize the Smart Control app to adjust EQ. In addition you can create automatic listening settings for different locations and adjust ANC. The touch controls are intuitive, and little luxuries like on-ear detection contribute to the overall flagship worthy experience of the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless. That you get a carry case and an airplane adapter means you don’t have to shell out for accessories either. Plus, the Sennheiser cans undercut the price of most premium headphones without significant compromises. Sennheiser does a pretty good job with the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless, although, it has some issues with noise rejection, but nothing unusual for headphones without booms. Take a listen to the following demo recordings. Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless microphone demo (Ideal conditions): Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless microphone demo (Wind conditions): Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless microphone demo (Street conditions): How does the microphone sound to you? Can’t go wrong with the new “old standby” AKG 371 Though people have been picking the Sony MDR-7506 for decades, a true successor in the “budget monitor headphone” category has finally taken center stage. The AKG K371 offers a really good baseline for what constitutes good sound in the consumer market. That’s not because these are super bassy, or that they’re flashy—if anything they’re the opposite of both. This pair of headphones sounds excellent for what it is, and provides a really good double-life as a dependable studio monitor. Sure, these are a set of wired cans with a rather cumbersome cable. But if you’re listening at home, mixing a track, or working at the coffee shop: these are the headphones you want. The HiFiMan Sundara is an excellent pair of high-end headphones Sure, you could spend thousands of dollars on headphones that may or may not sound better, but the HiFiMan Sundara is at the perfect crossroads between affordability and top-tier performance. Sure, that sounds a little weird to say for a set of $300 USD planar magnetic headphones, but our testing shows the Sundara does an excellent job at providing listeners with good sound quality when compared to its closest competitors. However, many headphones in this bracket are very heavy and uncomfortable, and the Sundara has this issue to an extent. However, the choice to use cloth in the padding of the ear cups and the form-fitting band do a lot to make this product far more comfortable to use for those who wear eyeglasses. If you don’t wear eyeglasses, all the better. Of course, as open-back headphones, these let in just about every sound around you. So be sure to note that before you start spending like crazy. Additionally, if you’d like to equalize these headphones any: you’re probably going to want an amplifier of some sort to avoid volume issues. Why should you consider the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700? While the ANC on the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 may not be as impressive as the company’s Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones, Bose has shown commitment to users by improving the ANC with a comprehensive firmware updates (version 1.8.2). You can view the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 ANC chart. We also like the NCH 700 for its sleek design and seemingly perfect touch controls. Many companies make calibrate their headsets’ touch panels to be too sensitive, resulting in many misfires, but Bose’s headset is a breeze to operate. The default frequency response (chart) is excellent and requires little fixing, but you can change it directly from the Bose Music app (iOS/Android) if you’d like. Those with unusually low voices may sound a bit “off” or “hollow” to those on the other end but this is to mitigate the proximity effect. For the most part, the NCH 700 microphone is quite good in all contexts since it filters out quite a bit of environmental noise. Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 microphone demo (Ideal): Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 microphone demo (Street): Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 microphone demo (Wind): How does the microphone sound to you? Audiophiles should consider the Drop x Sennheiser HD 6XX If you’re looking for the absolute best way to spend money on headphones for the computer, Drop’s partnership with Sennheiser brought a legendary audiophile option—the HD 650—down to roughly half the original asking price with the HD 6XX. Budget-conscious audiophiles would be doing themselves a disservice by not giving these a spin. There are a few minor differences between the HD 6XX and the HD 650 ($304.78 at Amazon), but most are cosmetic in nature. The performance of the HD 6XX is top-notch, and is much lighter than it looks. If you’re the kind of listener who spends a lot of time at the computer, this is the kind of headphones you should be looking for. Just be aware that the open back is a double-edged sword: it allows for better sound quality and clarity, but it also lets in all the outside noise around you. The best headphones: Notable mentions We can’t highlight every headset the way we’d like, so instead, we’ve put together a bulleted list of alternative standouts that didn’t quite make the best headphones cut. Apple AirPods Max: iPhone owners who want something beefier than the AirPods Pro for international flights should invest in the AirPods Max. We do mean invest: this set of headphones goes for $479.99 at Amazon but occasionally goes on promotion for less. This has some of the best ANC we’ve seen and excellent sound quality. If you have an iPhone you can take advantage of the headset’s H1 chips for hands-free Siri access, automatic device switching, Adaptive EQ, and more. Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT2: Enthusiasts sing the praises of the original ATH-50x for its rugged build and reliable performance. The second-generation Bluetooth version carries over everything we love about the tried-and-true wired model with LDAC support and excellent battery life for $199 at Amazon. At under $200 USD, this is a solid headset. Beyerdynamic DT 900 PRO X: If wired is your sole interest with a studio style frequency response, this is a great pick. The open back design wears comfortably, it gets very close to our ideal sound without reaching astronomical pricing ($249 at Amazon). Its closed back companion, the DT 700 PRO X, has less treble on tap and is another great choice. Bose QuietComfort 35 II: Yes, this headset is from 2017, but it still holds up today. The ANC keeps pace with some of the best headsets on the market, and comfort remains bar none. If you don’t care for the most premium hardware (e.g., USB-C charging) save some coin and get the QC 35 II instead of the QC 45. Grado SR80x: If you can’t shell out for top of the line open back headphones, these unique Brooklyn built on-ear headphones (for $125 at Amazon) are comfortable with repairable parts and a more trebly frequency response. Sennheiser HD 660S2: Certainly not the cheapest of the wired open back headphones on our list ($599.95 at Amazon), this set offers a very pleasant and analytical frequency response. Like most open back designs, it’s not for bass heads. If you find its predecessor, the HD 660S, for less cash it is equally good. The Sennheiser HD 600 is also a tried and true choice in the same style with replaceable parts. Hold up! Something’s different: Some of our picks’ frequency response and isolation charts were measured with our old testing system. We have since purchased a Bruel & Kjaer 5128 test fixture (and the appropriate support equipment) to update our testing and data collection. It will take a while to update our backlog of old test results, but we will update this article (and many others!) once we’re able with improved sound quality measurements and isolation performance plots. These will be made obvious with our new chart aesthetic (black background instead of white). Thank you for bearing with us, and we hope to see you again once we’ve sorted everything out. If you want more portable options, check out these earbuds Bose QuietComfort Earbuds: In typical Bose fashion, the QC Earbuds has excellent sound quality to boot and some of the best ANC around, save for the WF-1000XM4 from Sony. These earbuds are pretty bulky, as is the case, but they still fit comfortably because of the StayHear Max ear tips. You can pick it up for $189.99 at Amazon. Due to the tuning of the updated QuietComfort Earbuds II, we still prefer the originals. Google Pixel Buds A-Series: For the Android user seeking a good set of earbuds with Google Assistant integration can get these for $93.02 at Amazon. Those looking for ANC and some extra luxuries like spatial audio should check out the Google Pixel Buds Pro. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro: This is a truly great pair of wireless earbuds with solid sound and features like direct Spotify for easy listening. You get excellent ANC and 360 Audio too. Pick your favorite colorway for $189.99 at Amazon. Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 3: This is among the best wireless ANC earbuds you can buy and it has a premium design with an IPX4 rating. The Smart Control app lets you adjust the sound quality and you can find a very secure fit with the included ear and wing tips. The main downside, like many premium wireless earbuds, is the price ($169.95 at Amazon). Shure SE215: If you can forego true wireless for strictly wired earbuds, this set balances great sound, comfort, and Shure’s industry renowned reliability for only $99 at Amazon. Sony WF-1000XM4: These premium priced ($178 at Amazon) wireless earbuds have active noise cancelling, a decent microphone, and best of all sound excellent. Their battery life isn’t the best, but they offer quick charging to make up for it. These earbuds support SBC, AAC, and LDAC. When you download the Sony Headphones Connect app you can EQ the sound signature and enable adaptive sound control. What you should know about the best headphones Calling something “the best” at anything is controversial at best, so we create our best lists with the caveat that your experiences may vary from our own. Sometimes people have a unique set of needs, and that can’t be satisfied by going to a list of “best headphones” because the article doesn’t address what the best headphones out there are… for you. Consequently, we encourage all of our readers to write down all the things they want out of their headphones first—before rolling the dice on a pick. This list has a lot of all-time greats, but if you need something a little bit more tailored to your needs, definitely keep reading our other lists and features to arm yourself with enough knowledge to make the right purchase. Think hard about what types of headphones you like (in ears? over ears? on ears?), and also try to figure out what features you need. Maybe you need to go to the store to see how they fit on your head? Do you wear glasses or have ear piercings? Maybe you should look into getting velour pads instead of leather! These are all things covered in our reviews and other best lists. Are wired headphones better than Bluetooth headphones? This list has a few wired options if you want great sound, but we also have a few wireless options if you prefer convenience. If you opt for a Bluetooth pair, there are a few things you should know. First and foremost, the rumors you’ve heard are true. Bluetooth just can’t party with wired headphones, at least as it pertains to sound quality. Even some of the best codecs available aren’t as great as they seem at first glance. AAC is basically only good if you’re on an iOS device which means Android users should probably stick to aptX, and LDAC isn’t truly hi-res. The good news is that you most likely can’t hear any of the details in the data that’s being dropped, but it’s still not a great selling point. Of course, if you do think that you have superhuman hearing feel free to test yourself with our simple hearing test. There is hope, though: Bluetooth SIG announced LE Audio and the LC3 codec, an efficient alternative to SBC. We’re excited to see the benefits to the hard-of-hearing community play out in the real world, and know that LC3 will provide a 50% increase in audio quality relative to SBC. What’s more, headphone stutters will be lessened as packet-loss-management is improved, so instead of hearing annoying, intermittent drops, the dropout process will be much smoother. Even the best headphones will benefit from the new codec. We mentioned codecs in the last section, but what exactly is a Bluetooth codec? If Bluetooth is the technology that enables two devices to communicate with each other, then codecs can be thought of as the language that they speak. When two devices speak the same language, they can communicate faster and send more data between each other which results in better sound quality. Some of the best codecs have high transfer rates if both devices are compatible, and if they aren’t then everything just reverts down to the basic codec called SBC. Unfortunately, codecs can be a bit finicky and as we mentioned before don’t always work the way they’re intended to which is why wired headphones usually sound better. Though it is worth mentioning that Qualcomm’s aptX adaptive that seems promising, but we’ll have to wait to test it ourselves before we get our hopes up. How does active noise cancelling work? If you were wondering how active noise cancellation works, don’t worry you’re not alone. There’s a lot that goes into it and some companies like Bose and Sony have their own ways of achieving it technologically, but it all comes down to basic physics. Active noise cancelling is actually something called destructive interference. If you take one wave with an amplitude of +1 and combine it with another wave that has an amplitude of -1, you’re left with zero. Active noise cancelling headphones take advantage of this by using tiny microphones to hear what sounds are around you and then creating an opposite sound wave to cancel that before it reaches your ears. Of course, this isn’t perfect and works better for long, droning sounds then sudden, screeching ones. So don’t expect ANC headphones to block out that crying baby on your next flight. But when you combine noise cancelling technology with good isolation, you can get pretty close to completely blocking the outside world. This is harder to achieve when it comes to earbuds, as they don’t completely cover your ear. So instead, a solid pair of memory foam ear tips might be worth looking into as they do a better job at isolating sound than the silicone ones that come with most buds. How we choose the best headphones If you’d seen this list before, you’ll probably notice that it’s completely different than it was in years past. Now it’s a perpetually updated piece. Gone is the Sennheiser HD 800, and the rest of the exorbitantly expensive headphones. That’s because we realized that what’s “best” objectively, isn’t what’s “best” for everyone… so our selections needed a bit of tweaking. Just like it is with power tools and kitchen utensils, different headphones are built for different purposes. Using the right tool for the job is important, and ensures that you get the best experience possible. You wouldn’t use a chainsaw to cut butter any more than you’d use a set of AKG K7XX on an airplane. In that light, we took extra time to take into account how most people actually use headphones. What makes a good pair of gym headphones? What makes a good pair of wireless earbuds? What’s the good in having a best headphones list that doesn’t help most people buy headphones they like? While we took the time to highlight some Bluetooth headphones, active noise cancelers, and open-backed cans—be sure to read the descriptions to see if they’re right for you. Many people want a set of headphones that will do everything, but those models are few and far between. That’s why our winner isn’t a set of headphones you’d see on other outlets’ top 10. It’s more about what people actually want than what’s objectively the best performing set out there. While many might be upset that we chose more consumer-geared models than the stunning halo products of audiophile lore: it’s important to us that our readers aren’t dissatisfied with their headphones. To that end, we find that the ultra-expensive headphones are generally a poor fit for most, often leaving your average consumer frustrated and feeling like they wasted a lot of money. Those with a more developed idea of what kind of headphones they want should also check out our other best lists. Not every best headphone model listed here will meet all of your needs. With that being said, all of our picks were used by at least one team member, and all of these picks sound fantastic. Because our ad-free business model relies on you enjoying your headphones without returning them, this list represents what we earnestly feel is the most deserving of your money. We knew that we wanted to create a list of financially attainable headphones that meet realistic use cases, rather a drool-inducing, unrealistic list for your average consumer. Why you should trust SoundGuys on the best headphones In short, you should trust us because we show our work, strive to provide as much unimpeachable information to you, and pin our revenue model on the happiness of our readers with our recommendations. If you return the product we suggest, we don’t see a dime. When it comes to audio, the SoundGuys team has years of experience reviewing products between them (and even more listening to them). Chris spent years reviewing audio products, among other things, at publications such as USA Today and Reviewed.com, Lily clocked in countless hours at radio stations and reviewing products independently before joining our team, and Adam has been listening to headphones and speakers for nearly five years as part of SoundGuys. So needless to say, if a product makes best headphones list it’s because we were genuinely impressed by them and had some hands-on experience with them (or at the very least put in hours of research). Frequently asked questions about the best headphones I wish I could give you a definitive answer of one perfect pair of wireless headphones, but truthfully, the answer to this question depends on your personal preferences. Do you want really good active noise cancelling? Go for the Apple AirPods Max or Sony WH-1000XM5. Are you looking for great wireless sound quality and don’t want to spend a fortune? Check out the Audio-Technica AT-M50xBT2. Is long battery life important to you? Try the Anker Soundcore Space Q45. There are a lot of good headphones out there, and we do our best to outline all the objective facts and describe our subjective experiences with each product so you can make an informed decision based on your personal priorities. The Apple AirPods Max are bound to be a fine pair of headphones for any iPhone user, but the noise cancelling headset is extremely cost-prohibitive. It affords a lot to the right listener, though. Each ear cup houses Apple’s H1 chip for extensive processing power so the headset can deftly perform tasks like hybrid ANC, passthrough audio, hands-free Siri access, Spatial Audio, and more. If you have multiple Apple devices all synced up to the same iCloud account, you’ll enjoy automatic device switching. The Sony WH-1000XM4 feature several upgrades from the Sony WH-1000XM3 including improved noise cancelling, Bluetooth multipoint, and speak to chat functionality. That being said, the WH-1000XM3 is still an excellent pair of headphones, if outdated compared the even newer, WH-1000XM5."

Apple AirPods Max Wireless: The Apple AirPods Max Wireless are premium over-ears with an Adaptive EQ that adjusts their sound to the fit and seal of the headphones on your head. They have an outstanding noise cancelling performance, and their H1 chip allows you to seamlessly pair them with your Apple devices. However, there have been user reports of condensation forming on and in the drivers after a few hours of use. The Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless' superior ANC performance and sound customization features make them a better choice for most. See our review Bose 700 Headphones Wireless: The Bose 700 Headphones Wireless are worth considering instead of the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless if you're looking for something to use for calls or meetings. They have an excellent noise isolation performance, and their integrated mic has a much better performance. There's a drop in mic and audio quality when you're connected to a PC, but that's a limitation of Bluetooth.

Here’s how it works. The best headphones 2023: top cans from Sony, Bose and more The absolute best headphones in every style, for every budget Yes, there are newer models available, but we still rate the Sony WH-1000XM4 as the best headphones for most people when balancing performance and price. The audio quality is rich and exuberant, the noise cancellation is strong, they work wired or wireless, and they offer great battery life. For some very affordable earbuds that offer excellent audio quality, the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus remain among our favorites – they're just an incredible price these days. Matt Bolton, Managing Editor – Entertainment The best headphones are a must if you love listening to music, podcasts and movies. They’re essential if you travel regularly, have a lot of video calls, need music to focus while you’re working or to keep you motivated while you’re working out. There are many different types of headphones out there, and new ones are launched every week, which means finding the best headphones or the best earbuds for you isn’t easy. You have to consider several factors, including your budget, the features you need and any preferences you have about how they look and fit. For sheer sound quality you can't beat a good pair of wired headphones. But if you want the convenience of cable-free listening there are some excellent unwired options too. In fact, there are so many that we've put together two separate guides: one for the best wireless headphones and one for the best true wireless earbuds. We've also put together a guide to the best noise-cancelling headphones. They're particularly good for travelling or for drowning out the ambient noise of open-plan offices. If you're on a tight budget, though, some of the best over-ear headphones' ear cups do a pretty good job of cutting out ambient noise without any technological trickery. We've spent many happy hours testing the best earbuds and headphones over the years and over our ears, and we know exactly what makes a great pair of cans or buds: sound quality, of course, but also comfort and convenience. And you don't necessarily need to spend huge sums of money to get all three of those things, as this guide demonstrates. There's a huge variety of headphones and earbuds here, but they share important features that make them easy to recommend. Those features include comfortable design, class-leading audio performance, and useful extra features such as built-in voice assistants or rock-solid wireless connectivity. Whether you want to listen with your smartphone, laptop, or one of the best MP3 players, you won't be disappointed with any of these pairs – but if you're looking for gaming headphones with built-in mics, we'd suggest checking out our best PC gaming headset guide, as that's laser-focused on gaming performance, surround sound and in-game chat. The best headphones 2023: our picks The Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones deliver excellent noise-cancellation and sound quality in a design that we found comfortable and lightweight throughout our testing. They don’t look different from their predecessors, the Sony WH-1000XM3. However, new features, including multipoint pairing, DSEE Extreme upscaling, conversational awareness and auto-play/pause using a built-in sensor, mean they’re a significant upgrade. The WH-1000XM4 headphones also support Sony’s 360 Reality Audio format, which delivers spatial audio on stereo headphones, plus the LDAC codec that can send a bitrate of up to 990 kbps. However, it no longer supports aptX or aptX HD, so your hi-res audio support mileage may vary. There are a wonderful pair of wireless noise-cancelling headphones and deliver exactly what they promise and then some thanks to their exceptional noise cancellation and cutting-edge codec support. Read our full Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Headphones review 2. Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus Now that they've received a permanent price cut, dragging that tag down to more than half its original price, the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus are a much more appealing option than ever. Not that they weren't already at their original cost, receiving the coveted five-star rating in our review. A clear upgrade from its predecessors, these offering excellent audio performance, a helpful app, and easy-to-use controls. In terms of audio quality, we found during testing that they offer tons of dynamism and character, with a lively presentation, high accuracy, and a lot of detail. And, while there's no noise cancellation on offer, the sound isolation is very good. Finally, if you're ok with using them in low power mode, you should get up to nine hours of battery life per earbuds charge (up to 45 hours with the case). Read our full Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus review 3. Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless We said under intense review that Sennheiser's welcome update to its 2019 Sennheiser Momentum third-generation Wireless headphones would soon be sitting pretty within this buying guide, and here they are. The Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless are the newest August 2022-issue wireless over-ear headphones from Sennheiser and if Sony (listed above and below) isn't worried, it should be. These cans boast an incredible 60-hour battery life, a likeable app, an extensive feature set, easy on-ear controls, talented adaptive noise cancellation and a zealous sound that'll have you nodding your head happily wherever you go. Yes, they're a tad plain aesthetically, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and these headphones sound outrageously good for the level. Sennheiser has packed everything and the kitchen sink into the Momentum 4 Wireless’s spec sheet, including Sidetone to better hear your voice during calls and 'Sound Zones', EQ and ANC presets which can be set to magically kick in when you're, well, in the zone. Make no mistake though, the headline-grabber is still the sound. And what a sound it is! Think open, detailed, expansive, neutral and crisp. Never is it overly warm; never is it congested or muddied through the bass. Move over Sony XM5, there's a new set of cans in town and honestly, they're just that little bit better across the board. Oh, also, they're a little cheaper than the XM5… Read our full Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless review These new Sonys would be at the top of our table if it weren't for the fact that right now the outgoing model, the WH-1000XM4, is substantially cheaper and does almost everything the newer Sonys do. These are better headphones, but at the moment the XM4s are the better buy. In our Sony WH-1000XM5 review we said that the XM5s are \"the best headphones in the world thanks to their class-leading noise-cancelling features and well-balanced audio\". However, \"a steeper price point and similar functionality to earlier models make the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones an ever-so-slightly tougher sell than before.\" The new design is more elegant and contains slightly smaller drivers than before, and while there's less wind distortion the trade-off is that they don't fold neatly like the previous model did. The noise cancelling is best-in-class, doing an excellent job of muting the higher pitched sounds that ANC headphones tend to find challenging, and sound quality is exemplary. Your co-workers or fellow commuters won't take a dislike to you either: these headphones don't leak as badly as some over-ears do. The other headline feature here is battery life, which is now 10 hours longer: expect up to 40 hours with the ANC off and 30 with it on. If you don't already have noise cancelling headphones, these are as good as it currently gets – but the older, cheaper model is almost as good and better value as a result. Read our full Sony WH-1000XM5 review 5. Sony WF-1000XM4 Wireless Earbuds With the Sony WF-1000XM4s, Sony has combined performance, ergonomics, and build quality more effectively than ever before in a noise-cancelling true wireless package. During our testing we found that compared to their predecessors, the Sony WF-1000XM3, the newer wireless earbuds offer enough quality-of-life features to make them worth upgrading to, even if they are a little more expensive. Features like auto-pause and being able to tune the buds to the shape of your ears are truly useful. While other true wireless earbuds surpass the Sony WF-1000XM4 in particular areas – in terms of noise cancellation, for example – no other model comes close to offering such excellent quality across the board. That’s why the Sony WF-1000XM4 are hands-down the best true wireless earbuds you can buy today. Read our full Sony WF-1000XM4 review 6. Apple AirPods Pro 2 The Apple AirPods Pro 2 offer improved audio performance over the original AirPods Pro and fantastic ANC in a comfortable, true wireless form factor. The Pro 2 buds are a step up from the original AirPods Pro. Design changes might be subtle, but audio performance is upgraded with new drivers and amplifiers. During our testing, we rated the sound from the Pro 2 as brilliant—there’s rich audio across genres and a wide and expansive soundstage. ANC is also greatly improved and performs exceptionally well, we found it blocked out most external noises. Transparency mode is more useful too. It's adaptive, allowing you to have natural conversations when you don’t want to take them out. Battery life has been boosted to 6 hours from the buds with ANC on, and 30 hours from the charging case, which is now IPX4 water resistant—withstanding light showers and sweating—and has a speaker, handy if you lose them as you can activate a 'Find My' request. We still rate the original AirPods Pro, but the Pro 2 are one of our favorite options if you're looking for a pair of the best headphones in a true wireless design. If you want the comfort of over-ear headphones, there are better headphones on this list, like the Sony WH-1000XM4s at the top. But the AirPods Pro 2 prove you don't necessarily need an over-ear design anymore for truly immersive sound and excellent ANC from your headphones. Read our full Apple AirPods Pro 2 review 7. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro Samsung has truly turned a corner with its latest Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, which forego futuristic looks in favor of great 24-bit sound, head-tracked spatial audio and a design that fits comfortably. Apple, Sony, Bose, Sennheiser and in fact all of the best wireless earbuds manufacturers now need to take a good look at what Samsung has done with the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. They're good. No, really, they're good. These smaller, more comfortable and less arrogant earbuds (remember the rose gold, kidney-bean shaped Galaxy Buds Live? These are nothing like those) are packed full of useful perks such as excellent ANC, voice detect, wearer detection and customizable on-ear controls – all of which work very well indeed – plus IPX7 water ingress protection. But the headline-grabber, if you own a Samsung Galaxy device (and thus, access to the Samsung Wearable companion app and home-screen widget) is 360 audio with optional head-tracking, thus allowing you to use your phone as the focal point to direct more of that new end-to-end 24-bit high-res audio to whichever ear you prefer. Read our full Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro review 8. 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Headphone After testing the 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Headphones for a few weeks, we're certain that they deliver fantastic sound and equally fantastic value for money. That's why we consider them to be the best headphones for those who prefer wired earbuds. For $100 / £100 (about AU$168), it’s hard to find a better-sounding and more well-built pair of earphones than the 1MORE Triple Drivers – although if you want a little extra refinement and more luxurious materials, the same firm's 1MORE Quad Drivers are even more impressive, albeit at twice the price. But at this price, and with such excellent build and design, it’s hard to fault the Triple Drivers. The inbuilt remote feels a little cheap, but that's more than made up for by the lush sound quality offered by these luxe-looking earbuds. For the price, you can't do better than 1MORE's Triple Driver in-ear headphones. Read our full 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Headphone review The SoundMagic E11BTs are an extremely capable pair of wireless in-ear earphones, and given their low price, it really is difficult to fault them. The audio quality on offer here is fantastic with vocals sounding clear and smooth, while a hefty amount of bass helps elsewhere. Treble frequencies are sharp and crystal-clear too with a good level of attack. Although we also found that they might be a little harsh for anyone who wants to have a very warm soundstage. We found these headphones comfortable to wear thanks to their ergonomically designed eartips, and we thought they looked elegant too. They're attached to a flat neckband that didn't irritate our skin while running or working out. They have an IPX4 rating, which means they should withstand sweaty sessions, so they're a solid option as a spare pair of workout earbuds. Read our full SoundMagic E11BT review 10. Lypertek PurePlay Z3 2.0 When we first reviewed the original Lypertek PurePlay Z3 true wireless earbuds (then known as the Lypertek Tevi), we were blown away. The Lypertek PurePlay Z3 2.0 true wireless earbuds are their successors. They’re similar to the originals, include a few key improvements, and are available at the same affordable price point of $99 / £99. That price gets you everything we loved about the original PurePlay Z3, including detailed balanced sound, a whopping 80 hours total battery life from its petite USB-C charging case, and a comfortably fitting bud with physical buttons. But the Z3 2.0 earbuds also add wireless charging, a powerful new LDX Audio mode, improved app functionality and a hear-through ambient mode. The bad news is that we found the app connectivity to be patchy, and the ambient hear through mode isn't a patch on what you get from the likes of Sony’s noise cancelling WF-1000XM4. The hear-through mode is a shame, then, but these remain very impressive earbuds in terms of sound quality, stamina and affordability. They're more than a match for headphones two or three times the price. Read our full Lypertek PurePlay Z3 2.0 review 11. Bowers & Wilkins PX8 Sonically, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 are now the wireless over-ear headphones to beat. There, we said it. If that's all you need to hear, thank you for reading this particular buying guide. But if you want to know why we said \"sonically\" rather than \"across the board\", and why we gave them four-and-a-half stars rather than the full five, read on. The simple fact is that the B&W PX8 are expensive. There are good, tangible, understandable reasons for this – a new carbon cone 40mm drive unit replaces the bio-cellulose driver in the more affordable Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2 and the die-cast aluminum arms, diamond-cut bright metal detailing and Nappa leather trim elevates the build to high-end territory – but for some, anything priced hotter than the AirPods Max is too rich for the blood given the current financial climate. We hear you. But we have also heard the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 headphones and, cost of living crisis or no, they're exceptional. Read our full Bowers & Wilkins PX8 review 12. Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 If the Sony WH-1000XM4s are the current king of noise-cancelling headphones, the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are next in line for the throne. We think the Sonys sound slightly better, but the Bose noise cancelling is superior – so if you're a frequent flyer these may well be the better option for you. By applying noise cancellation to phone calls as well as music, Bose has made great strides in the field of noise-cancelling headphones. We found the sound quality to be undeniably good, with a vibrant, lively character and well-balanced soundstage. If you’re trying to decide between buying the Sony WH-1000XM4s and these Bose headphones, we’d recommend going for the former because of that lower price and better battery life – they're our number one pick for those reasons. But you wouldn’t be making a mistake if you opted for the Bose cans instead (and we wouldn’t blame you if you did) – they sound great, look stunning, and the noise cancellation is out of this world. Read our full Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 review 13. Bose QuietComfort Earbuds This is Bose’s second attempt at a set of true wireless headphones, and the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are leaps and bounds better than the older SoundSport Free. The design of these earbuds much improved and the noise cancellation is also exemplary. There are ten levels of ANC on offer here. At maximum, you’re practically cut off from the rest of the world, encased in a cocoon of sound that’s made entirely of your favourite tunes. You’ll only be able to hear some of the highest frequency sounds such as sirens, and even they’re muted to a large degree. The Bose headphones aren't quite as bassy as Sony's rivals, but we enjoyed their superb clarity and consistently impressive sound quality. During our testing, we found these noise-cancelling earbuds incredibly comfortable and well balanced, too, and while we expected their bulky form factor to be an issue they're much more comfortable than they look. Read our full Bose QuietComfort Earbuds review For just $79 / £69/ AU$99, the Jabra Elite 45h gives you Bluetooth 5 connectivity, 40mm full-range dynamic drivers and a smattering of physical push-button controls in a wireless on-ear frame. We like how the faux leather, memory foam and happily un-creaky plastic combined to deliver a fit we found extremely comfortable, although we weren't so keen on the way in which the ear pads reflect body heat right back: these phones get rather warm when you've been wearing them for a while. Tech-wise, they hit all the key features. There’s voice control available from Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri. Jabra’s Sound+ control app even walks you through a brief hearing test to establish exactly how the EQs should be set to best suit your ears, giving you a surprisingly personal experience compared to others in this price range. By the standards of overtly affordable headphones, the Elite 45h are feature-packed. Read our full Jabra Elite 45h review Testing the Sony WH-CH510, we were amazed that wireless on-ear headphones could cost this little while delivering really decent sound, a USB-C port, and 35 hours of battery life. If you’re looking for headphones at this price point, you’re likely already willing to make a few sacrifices. Thankfully, most of the compromises Sony has made with the WH-CH510 haven’t been too crucial – the lack of analog input mirrors, the loss of the 3.5mm port on most modern smartphones – and while the construction is a little plasticky they're lightweight, portable and comfortable. While they won’t have the superb clarity, balance, and sense of space that their WH-1000XM4 siblings deliver, the sound these on-ear headphones produce is much better than you'd expect from their size and price. You’ll find most genres perform well here, although tracks that already have low mids and bumped treble might get uncomfortably exaggerated. Read our full Sony WH-CH510 review If money's no object, the Focal Stellia headphones could be the best headphones on the planet. The wide open soundstage on offer here and detailed, accurate sound treatment means they make any genre of music sound brilliant. If you listen to songs you think you know inside out, the precise separation of the frequencies here means that you will probably hear details you’ve never noticed before. If you like to keep things minimal in the headphones department, you probably won’t like the showy, opulent design of the Focal Stellias, and they definitely do feel a little chunky for wearing on the commute into work. But if you like a bit of luxury, the full-grain leather cups, woven cables, brushed copper accents, and matching carrying case are likely to appeal. That luxury feel is translated right down to the presentation of the user manuals in a neat little leather-style wallet. But then you'd expect to find this level of detail when you're parting with $3,000 / £2,799 (about AU$4,200). Ouch.

Find out more about how we test. There's a lot to consider when you're buying a new pair of headphones. But the most important is the design. This doesn't just dictate how they look, but the features on offer, how they feel when you wear them and how you'll use them day-to-day. In-ear headphones, also called earbuds or earphones, are usually the cheapest and easiest way to pump audio into your ears. They rest in or just outside the ear canal, creating a tight seal to keep air out and sound in. These are the most discreet designs you'll find, making them excellent for portability and the prime choice for athletes. Over-ear headphones generally provide fantastic richness and depth of sound, which allows listeners to pick apart the instruments and sounds much easier. Additionally, over-ear, or circumaural headphones, go around the ear and offer a generous amount of padding. Instead of enveloping your ears, on-ear headphones create a light, breathable seal around your ear. The noise isolation is less effective than in-ear or over-ear options. But they're usually more portable than their over-ear brethren, appeal to travellers and make good fitness headphones. Some headphones don't go anywhere near your ears at all. Bone-conducting headphones send vibrations through your cheekbones and jaw up towards your inner ear, leaving your ears free. These headphones make great running headphones and swimming headphones. Wireless headphones fit into three different categories. Wireless in-ear earphones connected via a neckband are ideal for runners who want the freedom of a wireless connection with the security of a wire keeping their earbuds firmly around their neck. With wireless on-ear headphones and over-ear headphones, you simply lose the wire connecting them to your device – otherwise, they look pretty much the same as your regular pair of wired cans, and give you the noise-isolating prowess of over-ears without the need for cumbersome wires to connect to your device. True wireless earbuds have no cord whatsoever. For some, this means true freedom; for others, untethered true wireless means constant danger of losing their expensive audio kit down the drain – or terrible connections. The latter, at least, has changed now – thanks to advances in Bluetooth technology like aptX HD, the best true wireless earbuds have never sounded better. Are wired headphones better than wireless? Generally speaking, wired headphones do deliver better sound quality than wireless headphones. But there have been so many advances in audio tech in recent years, that with many of the best wireless headphones you're unlikely to notice a difference. That's why we often recommend audiophiles continue to opt for wired headphones. But for everyone else, it's mostly be down to personal preference. If wireless headphones suit you and are more convenient, they're a better choice for you. Get a good quality pair and you won't be missing out when it comes to sound quality. What are the best headphones I can buy right now? That depends on your preferences, style and budget. One of the most important considerations is design. Do you want a pair of in-ear headphones for running that are discrete and will stay snug all-day? Do you want a pair of true wireless headphones to give you ultimate flexibility? Or how about a big pair of over-ear headphones, the ultimate in noise cancellation and comfort? We've included a number of different headphone types below, like in-ear, on-ear, over-ear, wireless and true wireless. However, our top pick has to be the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones. They're fantastic all-rounders, offering a long battery life, noise cancellation, and excellent audio quality for the price. What is the number 1 headphone brand? There's no one perfect headphone brand out there. It all depends on your budget, audio needs, the features you want, and even the comfort or design involved with the headphones. That's why we've included numerous headphones covering different price ranges and feature sets. While major brands like Sony and Bose may stand out most, that doesn't mean you shouldn't rule out the others, with something for everyone out there. How we test the best headphones When it comes to the best headphones, we focus on sound quality above everything else. We look at both wired and wireless cans and earbuds that would appeal to audiophiles, as well as those working in professional roles. However, we also appreciate that budget is important too, so we compare like for like, picking out budget headphones that perform admirably for the price. We also look at other features such as ANC, battery life, fit, and of course the usability and extra perks offered by any companion apps. Of course, design and whether they look (and feel) good all adds to the model's desirability – and this is noted as we listen to music across a wide range of genres over several days. We have tested all of the headphones in this guide extensively, spending plenty of time analyzing the sound, fit, design, specs, and value for money so that you will be able to choose a product you'll be over the moon with.
