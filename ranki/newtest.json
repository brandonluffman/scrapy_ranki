Straight out of the box, the AirPods Pro have a sleek and modern design that stands out. The compact charging case is incredibly portable and fits easily into my pocket or bag, making it convenient to carry around. One of the standout features of the 2nd generation AirPods Pro is the active noise cancellation. It effectively blocks out ambient sounds, allowing me to fully immerse myself in my music or podcasts without distractions. The transparency mode is equally impressive, as it lets me stay aware of my surroundings when needed, making it perfect for outdoor activities or commuting. The AirPods Pro have an ergonomic design, featuring interchangeable silicone ear tips that provide a secure and comfortable fit. The snug fit ensures that they stay in place, even during vigorous workouts, without causing any discomfort. Sound quality is excellent, with clear audio and a well-balanced profile that caters to various music genres. The adaptive EQ feature automatically adjusts the audio to suit my personal preferences, ensuring an optimal listening experience every time. Battery life has been reliable, with up to 4.5 hours of listening time on a single charge and up to 24 hours with the charging case. The quick charging feature is a lifesaver when I'm in a hurry, providing around an hour of listening time with just a few minutes of charging. If I had to point out a drawback, it would be the premium price tag. However, considering the top-notch audio quality, noise cancellation, and other advanced features, I believe the investment is well worth it. To sum it up, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) deliver an exceptional listening experience with their comfort, sound quality, and advanced features. If you're looking for a versatile and reliable pair of true wireless earbuds, I highly recommend giving the AirPods Pro a try.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"LeviD \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/6883422599141817139/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:7977644765926870946_0,pid:11263843156781472965,rsk:PC_13143994692656166675&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz9OahiJD-AhVZElkFHXfHBU8QqSQIcg\", \"title\": \"Life-changing earbuds?\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"January 14, 2023\", \"content\": \"I can definitely see why folks are skeptical of $250 earbuds, there are certainly less expensive options out there that will work, some of them with cool features like transparency and noise cancelling. Some might even have better sound quality, style, and comfort...However it's what makes the AirPods Pro different that makes them special and indispensable. What sets the AirPods Pros apart is how well they work across your iCloud-connected devices, without having to un-pair and re-pair. Like magic, whatever Apple device you happen to be looking at is what your AirPods Pro are connected to! \\\"it just works\\\" as they say. Want to listen to a quick TikTok or take a call in a public place? Pop in an AirPod and have fun! You'll wonder how you lived without them! With a simple press and hold of the stem, they'll toggle between transparency and noise cancelling modes. Transparency is quite natural, effectively eliminating background noise while allowing you to hear important things like cars and sirens in the wild while still able to clearly hear your content; pausing your content, you'll be able to carry on a conversation with someone close by. The noise cancelling is some of the best I've ever heard, blocking out more noise than my Bose QC35-II and Sony XM4 cans; It's simply amazing. Finally, the Spacial Audio feature is really cool, but kind of gimmicky...I'm glad it's there, however because combined with transparency, a convincing \\\"illusion\\\" can be created where the device in front of you is playing sound, but only you can hear it. And all of that is great if you're all-in on the Apple ecosystem...If you have non-Apple devices, honestly it's probably best to look elsewhere for those devices. But like all things Apple, AirPods Pro really shine inside the walled garden. And if you're debating upgrading from the first-gen AirPods Pro to the new ones, I'd say wait for a sale. First-gen are still pretty great, and while the second-gen is even better, it's not a difference worth paying full price for.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"mykie242 \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/6883422599141817139/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:7977644765926870946_0,pid:11263843156781472965,rsk:PC_13143994692656166675&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz9OahiJD-AhVZElkFHXfHBU8QqSQIcg\", \"title\": \"Better innvovation and a leap foward\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"December 19, 2022\", \"content\": \"This has been my most compelling purchase in a long time! Apple just took audio integration to the next level. There are 4 major reasons to upgrade your AirPods to the pro gen 2. Its important to upgrade your iPhone with IOS 16.0 or higher in order to realize the benefits of these earbuds. Without this update you will not have access to adaptive transparency or the new spatial audio so before testing make sure you do this step. 1. Sound - The clarity and detail these produce is astounding, especially with the new custom spatial audio activated, but we will get to that later. Bass - sub frequencies now extend all the way down to 20 hz vs the gen 1s 40 hz so it goes low! Not only is it lower but it\\u2019s a lot more present, they finally gave these buds the oomph they needed to compete with the top tier wireless audio! They simply cover a better range of sound when listening and offer a more complete listening experience. I use Spotify almost exclusively and with some tweaks in the Spotify 6 ban EQ I actually prefer this sound profile over my Sennheiser MTW3 earbuds which are widely regarded as some of the best sounding earbuds on the market. 2. Adaptive transparency - The Adaptive transparency feature has been such a game changer for me. Basically it filters out any loud sounds over 95 DB and automatically lowers that sound to match everything else you hear. This does not sound like that big of a deal but for those of us who use earbuds for several hours a day in noisy environments it changes the game. No more worrying about the deafening jolt of a dog barking, or a car honking in transparency mode, the new H2 chip lets you hear your environment as if you had no earbuds on at all, very natural and without the worries of yesterdays deafening surprises. 3. Spatial audio - This might be the feature that surprised me most only because the older version of spatial audio did not do much and had very few applications to use it with. With the new update this version of spatial audio is such a substantial improvement it cannot be overstated. Apple has a customizable feature for spatial audio when you hold the phone about 10 inches from your ear the LiDAR scans your ear canal in order to figure out the proper sound implementation. I know it sounds very gimmicky, but it actually works very well. I am now a believer. I went from watching an occasional movie with the old version to now almost exclusively leaving the spatial audio on. It adds an incredible amount of soundstage and depth! So not just hearing voice and instrumental separation from left to right but also you can distinguish sounds from front to back as well. And this works for music but it noticeably changes my podcasts also. It sounds like your actually in the room listening live now! Try the song Bubbles by Yosi Horikawa it will blow your mind!! 4. ANC - Considering how light and comfortable the gen 2s are I\\u2019m deeply impressed with how much noise is filtered out. It eliminates the all lower frequencies like AC or a treadmill and it brings voices down to a very slight whisper. Even while listening to a podcast when ANC is activated you will not hear anything else around you. It\\u2019s a marked improvement over my MTW3. Other improvements - The Case has a speaker now and let\\u2019s you track it within a foot when lost, just open the find my app and it will guide you with an arrow to where the case is. Full Siri integration, you can use Siri for everything from turning on Transparency mode, or ANC, to playing music, to listening and sending messages, weather updates, making calls ect. You can be 100% hands free the whole day if you wanted to be. Volume button - finally apple! now you can slide up or down on either earbud stem for volume control, it feels awkward at first but you get use to it quickly. I will update with any issues if I run into with them but as of now I can\\u2019t think of a single flaw these have other then maybe the lack of color options. If you have an iPhone these are a must! Let me know if this helps.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Ally \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/6883422599141817139/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:7977644765926870946_0,pid:11263843156781472965,rsk:PC_13143994692656166675&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz9OahiJD-AhVZElkFHXfHBU8QqSQIcg\", \"title\": \"Truly Amazing ANC\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"October 14, 2022\", \"content\": \"I've used a lot of different kinds of headphones and I've admitted that the first gen airpods stole my heart and I haven't looked back since.

When I saw the improvements on these I was too tempted to pass them up. They sound better than my regular Airpods and I like the ability to have more variety of controls. There was just double tap on left and right for the regular version. I had my left one set to play/pause and right to go to the next track. On the Pro 2 it took some getting used to squeezing instead of tapping, but now I can squeeze once to play/pause, twice for next track or 3 times for previous track. These also have the ability to adjust volume by sliding your fingertip up or down the flat part of the stem. It took some getting used to too, but now it's easy. Spatial audio is a cool feature too, but not one that sold me on these. It's just a plus, not something that I would spend extra for. I like the Adaptive Transparency, though I need to fine tune it. Unlike my cheap brand of earbuds, the adaptive transparency seems to filter out most wind noise instead up just amplifying it so that the feature was useless in the wind on the cheap brand. I haven't tried riding my bike in these yet, but walking down the street with wind doesn't blast my ears out. It comes with several tips for different ear sizes, though I'm just using the ones it started me with. I don't know how much difference it makes, but it had me sweep my camera across my ears to get an awareness of the shape of them and adjust the audio for me specifically. That was cool, but I didn't use them without it for comparison. I like that I can see them or the case in my Find My app too in case I need to locate them. I also like that this case can charge wirelessly as opposed to my non pro Airpods and the speaker is nice to let me know when they start charging. And these last almost through my whole workday before needing a charge. Even then, they charge up a lot in a short period of time, so I can just plug in for a few minutes to make it through the rest of the workday. It's a splurge for sure with them being overpriced, but if you have some extra and like the ease of the ecosystem it's a good purchase.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"xtwentyseven \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/6883422599141817139/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:7977644765926870946_0,pid:11263843156781472965,rsk:PC_13143994692656166675&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz9OahiJD-AhVZElkFHXfHBU8QqSQIcg\", \"title\": \"Audio quality blew my mind\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"October 19, 2022\", \"content\": \"I honestly didn\\u2019t think I needed these until I finally got them. And I only got them because I needed new headsets (or earphones) for work, but I also didn\\u2019t want to spend that much money for the AirPod Max. The moment I tried these on for the first time, the audio quality blew my mind. It took about two weeks getting used to them because they hurt my ears regardless of earplug size. Once I finally broke into them, I could wear them comfortably for hours. The adaptive transparency feature is definitely something you don\\u2019t think you need until you finally use it. There are plenty of articles online explaining all of their features, so I\\u2019m not going to deep dive into that. I will say, connecting to a Mac is seamless, I love that it recognizes when I pull them out and pauses streaming music/videos. I use them during zoom meetings at work, and my audio (and voice) is always clear. Coworkers can\\u2019t even hear my background noise. Battery life for the earphone could use some improvement, but from what I\\u2019ve been reading, using transparency or noise canceling causes it to drain faster. Note to those who use Logitech MX keys and mouse. You\\u2019ll need to use the unifying receiver with the peripherals because these AirPods don\\u2019t play nice with other Bluetooth devices (too much interference). My coworkers said my voice sounded robotic like a transformer during my zoom meetings. The only solution was to switch those peripherals from Bluetooth to unifying USB receiver, which was a bummer because I didn\\u2019t want to use up two USB ports.

I purchased the Apple AirPods Pro 2nd generation before being able to test them in ear. I had heard some of the pre release reviews and liked what I was hearing from the reviews so I took the plunge and ordered through the apple website on release day. I won\\u2019t do a super deep dive into all the specs and experiences. I will sum it up the best I can. The earbuds are aesthetically appealing and provide that recognizable apple design to anyone who glances over. It feels premium and has many fittings that allow the ear bud to fit well in most anyone\\u2019s ear. My daughter uses mine quieter often by switching out the earpiece to a smaller size. It works ok for working out but not the ideal earbud of hitting the treadmill. The interaction /connection between IPhone and earbud is near instant. The battery lasts a good amount of time, there is much to like. In terms of sound, the spatial audio seems gimmicky, not sure that anyone will find it revolutionary. The sound quality is ok at best. At the price point there are other brands that have better overall clarity and dynamics. I like to listen to my audio at high levels, the AirPods Pro don\\u2019t allow me to get as loud as I like. Probably something to do with their health app and monitoring loud noises\\u2026.not sure but I can\\u2019t rock out as much as I would like. The ANC (active noise cancelling) is better than Gen 1 but again, other brands at this price point do it better. I wear a lot of online meetings , virtual classes and situations where I am on speaker for larger groups. I have been told that my wired earbuds from many years ago sound a bit clearer than my new AirPods. That may be a situational or isolated issue as many others have said they have good performance in those areas. Overall, it depends on what you are looking for in an earbud. If you want one for working out, there is a better option. If you want one for audiophile performance, there are better options. If you want the best ANC, there are better options. It may not be the best in any category but If you want an all rounder that does everything well. These are undeniably a recognizable product that will meet expectations.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"piotr.d \\u00b7 Review provided by influenster.com\"}]",

The design has definitely improved, and it feels sturdy despite the slimmer build. It folds flat, nice and compact in the equally sturdy case. There's USB-C support for charging, and it doesn't take too long to charge either -- but that's where the positives end. I'm a longtime fan of Sony headphones, but this pair is definitely my worst. Here's why: - The noise cancelling is really, really bad. I was patient and waited for Sony firmware updates, and while Sony did tweak some of the settings, none of the updates since June have done the headphones any good in terms of noise cancelling *quality*. Sure, the headphones can now automatically change noise cancelling intensity based on location and movement, but the changes are now so jarring and inconsistent, thus making the updates feel more like a massive downgrade. Here's a daily scenario: you walk to your bus stop, the headphones then switch to a different noise cancelling setting because it remembers that your local bus stop is a saved location (and if you haven't saved it, you'll receive an annoying amount of notifications for any of your regular locations, including any bus stops you're regularly at as part of your commute); you get on the bus, and the headphones change to a different noise cancelling intensity...but at every stop, your headphones think that you got off, so the automatic motion detection switches to \\\"walking mode\\\"...imagine this on a 10-stop bus commute, and the number of times your headphones switch from commuting-walking-commuting-walking-commuting... Then imagine the occasional stop because of traffic lights, the occasional roadwork, traffic... For some reason these headphones seem to think that \\\"commuting\\\" means \\\"non-stop fast travel from start to end\\\". Having to constantly tweak the settings on my commutes when I just want to relax and enjoy music or podcast or even just silence is definitely not a good start to the day. - These headphones will occasionally turn off for no reason. Sometimes they restart, sometimes they just turn off without restarting, adding to the endless list of disruptions that you can expect to experience while using these headphones. - It's great that you can easily control volume and playback by swiping on your earcups...so long as you don't rely on the option to connect two devices at a time -- a great feature, but one that often disables (for some odd reason) the ability to use gestures to control playback and volume. You'll never know when this happens, but I can assure you of this -- it *will* happen. - There's the option to use \\\"Spotify Tap\\\", with two open slots, both for the same feature (which is very odd): you can just switch from one Spotify playlist to another Spotify playlist...which one are you switching to? No idea, it just switches it to a random playlist...and I have no idea why this was added as a \\\"feature\\\". - Although Google Assistant is still advertised as a great feature for this pair...it's actually not available. Google have revoked this feature, and it's not even a new announcement, but for some reason Sony still advertises this as a selling point. - No worries if you still want to use a voice assistant function -- there's Alexa...which works...so long as you keep the app open...but if you have the app open on your phone, you may as well just use your phone while you're at it -- which leads me nicely to my final point: These headphones were not meant for you to listen to music or whatever form of entertainment you want to enjoy. These headphones were meant for you to use -- use the app to correct the frequent mistakes, constantly swipe across the earcups and press the buttons to fix the errors, regularly open the Sony app to tweak the settings of your noise cancellation, and hope that you won't have someone around you nudging you about how bad the sound is leaking from your headphones while the volume isn't even at 50%. These headphones are a huge step back for Sony -- sure, they packed a lot of innovation and great tech in it, but with the constant tinkering I've had to resort to these past few months, these headphones feel more like a really expensive gadget to with, and less like a pair of headphones.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"benkellis \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Unbelievable noise canceling! Excellent sound!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 24, 2022\", \"content\": \"If you're looking for the best active noise canceling, over-ear headphones... look no further! The quality of noise canceling is second to none, somehow, Sony has taken the best ANC headphones and improved the ANC! Okay, on to the review. The Sony WH-1000XM5s have amazing sound quality, a nice finish (the black does attract fingerprints, at least at first), very comfortable for extended wear, and easily adjustable. The only thing I wish would have been kept around is the ability to fold the headphones like the previous versions, the case for the XM5s is a bit bulky, but you can clip it to a backpack or slide it into a bag pretty easily. The case also holds an included USB-C charging cable and 3.5mm cable in a magnetically sealed compartment and covers the entirety of your high-end headphones, unlike some of Sony's competitors. The thinner headband is nice, I can't really speak to how it may affect one's hair, but it leaves a smaller headband imprint on my bald head and has a barely there feel to it. The earcups are very comfortable and have ample room, even for those with bigger ears! They retain some of the best features of Sony's other ANC headphones, such as: touch controls on the ear cup, cover-to-speak/hear ambient mode, ANC/Ambient/\\\"normal\\\" mode button, 3.5mm ability, highly adjustability in the Sony Headphones app, auto-mode switching based on activities. The ambient mode has the ability to focus on voices, instead of just the general ambient noise and the ability to adjust the level of the ambient noise let in is a very nice feature to have. Pairing that with the auto-mode switching and \\\"speak-to-chat,\\\" which switches the headphones to voice-focused ambient mode when you begin to speak and turns off after a predetermined (and adjustable) amount of time, make for an amazing set of headphones for working in the office, taking on flights, trains, busses, and walking around. Now, they are not claimed to be water or sweat-resistant or IP rated in any way, kind of a bummer on for headphones that seem as though they'd be a perfect pairing for running or working out, but most of the nicer headphones lack an IP rating. In my testing of them, they've held up to some pretty sweaty runs. I do dry them off immediately and leave them off and out of their case for about an hour afterwards and they look, sound, and function perfectly. Something that each individual will have to decide if they're willing to take that risk with such a nice set of headphones. Overall, I would definitely recommend the Sony WH-100XM5s to those looking for great audio quality for music, videos, and calls with amazing active noise cancelation for the times you wish to be isolated from outside noise. I could see these being a perfect fit for a frequent traveler, a music loving office worker looking to focus, and anyone who likes to head the world around them in excellent clarity while wearing their over-ear headphones! I am absolutely loving these and think they're worth the bump in price from the previous generation (XM4) by improving on the previous generation in all ways except for the ability to fold.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Mike \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Some stuff is good some stuff needs to be improved\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 3, 2022\", \"content\": \"The surface of the arch that fits your head is very thin, this looks good, but it makes it so that the point of contact in your head is minimal. Since only a small part of this surface touches your head, there is a lot of pressure on it, and after an hour, the top of my head starts hurting, and I have to move the ring around throughout the day to avoid this pain, which is very annoying. The headphone comes with sensors which detect if you have them on. It comes with an app where you can choose if to turn the headphones off when you take them off your head by using the sensor. This is amazing for saving batteries meaning you don't have to charge them often because you forgot to turn them off manually. The problem is you can choose a timer for the to turn off and turn off immediately after taking them off, making it very annoying when you want to take your headphones off for multiple reasons like going to the toilet, talking to someone else or simply moving them around to find a more comfortable position, they turn off and if you are in a meeting on slack or teams, skype you will have to go through the process of connecting a device to these apps again which is very annoying. On top of that, I like to put a hoodie on and the headphones on top simply because it makes me feel warm, but the sensor picks that I am not wearing the headphones properly and turns them off; this is super annoying too. The only solution is to turn the feature which turns the headphones off automatically and remember to turn them off manually myself which I always forget and end up having to charge them more often than I would like to. The solution would be to let us put a timer when they should turn off so I could conveniently set them up to turn after 5 minutes of having them off, but alternatively only allow them to turn off if there is no audio playing. This would make it so that I can take them off for short periods of time without having them turned off and so that I could wear them however I want them without turning them off as long as I am listening to music or on a call with someone else. The problem with the small contact point and the pain at the top of my head, well this is a design flaw and I do find myself not wearing them often on purpose if I don't have to due to the discomfort and instead play my laptop speakers. The noise cancelling and audio quality is superb and the ambient mode is decent. I have 10 days to keep them or return them, and I am leaning more towards returning them.

I am still left in a maze to navigate their website in and out of hyperlinks to figure out which button or surface space does what. For an extremely high price these headphones are less about quality sound and more about noise canceling. If you like great audio, these aren't the headphones for you as they muffle and distort the sound. In general, noise canceling does that so that isn't a complete surprise. An astonishing and ridiculous issue I have with these headphones is that you CANNOT USE THEM WHILE THEY CHARGE?! In this era of device demand, this is a shockingly ignorant choice on the part of Sony. I get it, they might think since wireless earbuds can't be used while charging then who needs to listen to their headphones while they charge? Or perhaps they prioritized a fast charge over listening. The problem with that comes when you quick charge devices over and over again for short periods of time ruining the battery performance. Sony is practically begging you to do that by discouraging you from being able to listen to them at the same time as fully charging them. Overall I appreciate being able to drown out a good amount of background noise but I am left questioning if that's really worth the $400 price tag. If you are looking for noise canceling, pick a pair of great sounding earbuds and skip the actual noise canceling feature, just purchase some flight line ear protection headphones for a much better comfort and outside noise control. You'll save yourself hundreds while having a much lighter pair of headphones that doesn't overheat your ears. Another disappointment of mine was the erroneous idea that connecting to two devices at the same time would mean I could actually listen to two inputs at the same time. Perhaps Bluetooth isn't there yet through no fault of Sony, but I also felt the advertising was misleading on this particular feature and the answer was buried in Bluetooth spec and tech sites and not disclosed on the Sony site. I like that my phone can interrupt my business meeting playing from my computer but I dislike that I cannot listen to ambient sound on Pandora while participating in a business meeting at the same time. Since the audio can't be independently adjusted in noise volume by your individually connected device, you are left with a ring tone set to the same volume as your YouTube video or conversely the YouTube video resumes as loudly as the call and that is mildly annoying.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"AverageListener \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Great upgrade to an already great product\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"June 1, 2022\", \"content\": \"I purchased my first noise cancelling headphones in 2017 and, after a significant amount of research decided on the MDR-1000X. I have been extremely happy with the quality of these products to the extent that I then purchased my wife a pair of WH-1000XM3, the upgraded version of my headphones in 2019. We were both extremely happy with the design, comfort, ease of use and quality of the products. The main reason for purchasing them was for travelling, and making long-haul flights more enjoyable without the distraction of the plane and other background noises. The WH-1000XM5 are, however, a significant step up from these previous products. Firstly, the headphones feel significantly lighter, which is always a plus for travelling. The previous versions used to fold away into their carry case with a bit of twisting, which I always was worried about in case of getting it wrong, having to double check each time that I folded the correct ear. To be fair, it was easy enough, but with this pair, there is no need for this and they simply fold flat back into their case, which makes easier The carry case is a bit bigger, which therefore takes a bit more room in your hand luggage, but has room within it for all cabling (audio and charger), which is a good. I actually think the latest version are more comfortable as well - but it is marginal. I always felt noise cancelling was great on the previous product and it is equally so on the new version. The big plus for me is that there is now no need to run the noise cancelling optimiser for different surroundings. OK, it was fairly simple by pressing a button, but it took about a minute to complete. There is no need for this with the XM5's, as apparently they auto optimise based on your surroundings - which is great. There are other new features that you have to get used to: - the headphones automatically pause what you were listening to when you take them off, and restart when you put them back on - confusing at first when testing, when you think you must have pressed something by accident, but it is a feature which is quite useful - similarly, if you start speaking, the headphones recognise this, pause your music and switch to ambient mode so you can hear - ideal for when you are asked if you want a drink on the plane! Apparently you can pair the headphones to 2 devices simultaneously, in case you are listening to music on a laptop but want to still receive calls!? That is not really relevant for me, so I have not tried it. Battery life is claimed at 30 hours and a 10 minute charge apparently provides 5 hours of battery use. Again, I cannot validate these figures - but have not experienced any issues. In short, they charge quickly and last a long time! Sound quality is pretty important when buying headphones and this is where they come into their own, and I personally think they offer a much fuller sound than my original 1000X, with impressive bass. They are a real step up. In summary, these are really excellent headphones from every perspective and I was pleasantly surprised at how they improved on what I previously thought were perfectly adequate 1000X. I am very happy that I have the new ones, especially as now we can fly again so hopefully I will get chance to use them more often.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"GrenA \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"The BEST just got BETTER!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 27, 2022\", \"content\": \"Sony has done it yet again; they\\u2019ve actually improved upon what I feel are the BEST noise cancelling wireless over-ear headphones available! The WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are the newly released version from Sony and they have added even more user-friendly features and technology than the previous versions\\u2026and updated the look to a more modern design. What\\u2019s in the box - The headphones ship with a great zippered carrying case, a USB-C fast charging cable, an audio cable for wired connection and instructions/paperwork/360 Music offer. The headphones fold much easier compared to the previous versions. There is no more origami-like folding, just turn the ear cups and put them in the case\\u2026which is a good size for traveling. They fit perfectly in the outside pocket of my backpack. The earphones were fully charged out of the box, so all that\\u2019s needed to get started (optional really, as they headphones will connect to your Bluetooth device anyway) is download the Sony Headphones Connect app and set up the earphones. There was a software update available for the headphones and it updated once they were connected. Fit and Function - The first thing I noticed was the new sleeker, more modern looking and lighter design of the XM5s. Although the design has changed, the comfort level is as plush and comfortable as ever. The ear cups and headband are super plush and easy to adjust to your head size. I've been wearing them almost non-stop for the last couple of days and there are no hotspots or uncomfortable rubbing. Hold the power button for a couple of seconds and then the magic starts, the noise canceling technology is fantastic, literally cutting out all the background noise as I mowed the lawn, went running or just listening to music while working around the house (my wife texts me as I can't hear her!). With the Auto Switching Based on Action, the noise cancelling level adjusts to your activity and the outside noise. Sound Quality - The sound quality is the BEST I've ever heard from Bluetooth NC headphones. Straight out of the box these things rock, but the Headphone Connect app gives the user the ability to set custom preferences for sound and services. From a noise canceling perspective Sony touts 8 total microphones and a newly designed 30mm driver to provide optimized noise canceling performance. So the 1000XM5s provide industry leading noise canceling and music that is so crisp and clear on the highs and the bass is rich and deep. Quality sound as expected from Sony! Headphone Connect App - it's a great tool for taking advantage of the many settings these headphones provide like Adaptive Sound Control, Noise Canceling Optimizer, Surround, Equalizer, Sound Quality Mode, Voice Assist, etc. Open the app, turn on the headphones and hold them close to connect and you\\u2019re ready to customize the earphones. The app is broken into four sections: Status, Sound. System and Services. Some of the functions are automatic like the Adaptive Sound Control - this will detect your surroundings and adjust the headphones accordingly. You can also select the Noise Canceling levels. The System tab is all about the operational settings like Auto Power Off, Touch Sensors, etc. Super easy to use and a great tool that\\u2019s very well laid out for the user. Cool (and totally useful) Functions - Not only do these headphones rock, they are loaded with super cool and totally useful Touch Features so you can adjust the music level, FF, Pause, answer phone calls, etc. by simply touching the right ear cup. And if that isn't enough, Sony has upped the game by adding Speak-To-Chat which stops the music and let\\u2019s in ambient sound so you can hold a conversation without having to take the earphones off or cover the right earphone (which still works) as the previous version supported. The other new function that really stands out to me is the Automatic Off (Wearing Detection) feature. By simply taking the headphones off, music is instantly paused until they are put back on\\u2026then the music instantly starts up again automatically. Not sure how Sony will add more features to these headphones in the future\\u2026but I\\u2019m sure they will do something amazing! Phone Calls \\u2013 Sound is great both on the speaker and headphone sides. No complaints from anyone I\\u2019ve talked to on the headphones. Your music will start right back up once the call is ended. Totally hands free and couldn\\u2019t be any easier to use! Battery Life - As mentioned, they came fully charged and after multiple days of use, they are still at 60%...this absolutely crushes the battery performance of my other NC headphones. And on top of that, there\\u2019s a quick charge feature that adds 3 hours of charge in just 3 minutes. Worrying about battery life is completely off the table based on my experience to date. Pros: - Noise Canceling and Sound Quality are second to none - Support for connecting to 2 different devices simultaneously - Ease of adjustability of sound and functions - Touch & Automatic Controls - control your music, pause or call without ever touching your phone - Fit and comfort is outstanding, even after hours of use \\u2013 no hot spots - Sony\\u2019s Headphone Connect App give the user complete control over setup and functionality of headphones - Taking Phone Calls - crisp and clear even in a crowded room - Recycled packaging is a nod to the environment by Sony Cons: - The new case is a bit larger than in the past, not a huge issue, but something that stood out The Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are by far one of my new favorite devices and would 100% recommend them to anyone looking for the BEST noise canceling and function-packed over-the-ear headphones available.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"mstanleynh \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"These might just be as good as it gets..........\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 30, 2022\", \"content\": \"Ok, these are the first 'over the head' high quality wireless headphones I have used and I have to say they have set the bar really high. I have some top end wired Sony Hi Res headphones with no noise cancelling along with some competitors wired noise cancelling headphones and these beauties are on par if not better than both. Firstly the aesthetics are very good, you receive them in a Sony blended material box that might be completely recycled but has a nice solid feel to it and looks nice. Then, when you open up inside is the carry case which may be a bit thicker than I'd like but I'm happy to live with it as it keeps the contents safe. The first view of the WH-1000XM5 is impressive, nice matt finish with classy leather essentials that are very very comfortable indeed and I didn't find my ears getting too hot after 4 hours of continual wear. I'm not sure about all day comfortable but I don't think I could wear any headphones all day. The side panel with all the little tweaks and tricks is a joy to use after looking at the accompanying guide and very quickly becomes intuitive. This is very cleverly done and it seems they were developed with someone who has a similar brain to me because they just work. The sound is really really good with full range and depth, I don't know if I'm imagining it but feel it's not quite as expansive as when they are plugged in via the included cable, that being said Marvin Gaye singing Mercy Mercy Me in Hi Res on my Xperia 5ii is absolutely sublime with all the layers coming through nicely and Marvins smooth voice an utter joy. The noise cancelling is really effective and again the handy side panel enabling you to just hold it to hear is so handy. It makes you feel like it is just you and the music which is exactly what I want. I have used the 360 audio before with other Sony headphones and I have to say these seem to get a bit more out of the separation truly surrounding you with glorious sound. I subjected them to War Of The Worlds Multi Channel and it was absolutely stunning, I was completely lost for the duration, hanging on to Richard Burtons every word and emerged into the story completely. The bluetooth range is outrageously good compared to anything else I have, with the phone in the house I can reach the end of my garden (30m+) with ease and that's on 'Sound quality preferred' setting! All in all I'm struggling to find fault with these at all, maybe the price but realistically is there anything better out there? I'm not sure there is.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"occasionalstan \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Much improved sound quality and comfort\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 27, 2022\", \"content\": \"Sony have excelled once again improving from the previous WH-1000XM4 headphones which I didn't think was possible. These headphones are definitely more comfortable to wear for longer periods in part because the of the shape of the earcups, but more so because of the improved feel of the soft leather padding around the earcups. They also appear to provide much better soundproofing from exterior noise as they fit closer to the shape of your face, and that's without switching on Noise Cancelling which is excellent. Putting the headphones onto your head is now so much easier with the sliding headband, no more clicky settings, they just fit first time and I found the band very comfortable, possibly more so than the 1000XM4's. As for the touch controls on the right earcup, I think sensitivity may have been improved as sliding my finger up and down or across the cup face worked first time every time. Taking phone calls also worked very well, could hear my caller no problem and same for the person calling hearing me clearly. The voice pickup to temporarily pause music playing when talking to someone is nice to have as well and didn't let me down, can be activated/de-activated in the Sony app, your choice. As for sound quality, they are superb and is probably somewhat dependant on quality of the music files played. If you can play Flac/Lossless files using LDAC audio then you will love them as Sony have clearly done work on improving all aspects of the sound stage. I have played Classical, Pop, Rock and Electronic music files and in my opinion the instrument separation from bass through middle to treble was much clearer, especially in the top range. Bass wasn't overbearing, but you can make it so from your sound source and it might overtake the mid to high notes, but everyone has their own preference, just saying you can boom the bass if you want it. All in all I think Sony have a winner once again. If I was to find one thing I didn't like so much, it's the case. I know its a different setup to the folding 1000XM4's case which I really like, albeit you can't fold that down flatter like the one provided with the 1000XM5. A minor niggle that doesn't detract from a great pair of headphones.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Mel2955 \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 27, 2022\", \"content\": \"Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones The Sony WH-1000XM5 are so impressive featuring new drivers with flagship superb features and design, active Noise Cancelling (ANC) Fantastic for home, office, travel the list is endless. Optimised for Alexa and Google Assistant. The headphones are covered in a soft coating leatherette they are very comfortable to wear. One of the first things you notice when you open the box is the environmental packaging It's unbleached and wholly recyclable and uses no plastic whatsoever. The headphones are made mostly from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) which is useful material in acoustic terms which is mostly produced from recycled plastic and can be recycled again at the end of its life. So full marks to Sony for doing this. The Sony WH-1000XM5 main controls use capacitive touch panel on the right ear cup with actions as follows: Swipe Up = Volume Up Swipe Down = Volume Down Swipe Forward = Track forward Swipe Back = Track back Hold (Centre) =Voice assistant Double tap centre= Pause / resume Cup hand =. Ambient sound pass through On the left ear cup you will find two buttons, a power button and ANC mode button.Hold down the power button turns the headphones on after three seconds pairing will start, after that you can pair with your phone/computer. If you press NC/AMB button you can toggle the ANC mode, you are able to select the ANC/ANC off. The Ambient sound mode lets you hear what\\u2019s going on around you. You connect the headphones via Blue tooth or a TRS cable. When you listen to the WH-1000XM5 via the wired connection you turn the headphones on and that enables the ANC or leave them off. They sound quite different in passive mode. At the bottom right is a USB-C Charging port that allows you to charge the headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect App works great with these headphones and I highly recommend that you download it. Also you can get the latest updates for your headphones. Battery life for these Sony headphones is approx 30 hours on a full charge, if the battery is flat you can charge for just 3 minutes you will get 180 minutes of playback or of course you can always use the 3.5mm cable for analog playback. The headphones tend too boost the bass a bit too much with a detriment of the midrange however by using the App you can use the equalisation feature to tailor to your liking. These Sony Headphones support Sony\\u2019s high bit rate codec called LDAC which gives very good sound quality. On using the wired connection I found the sound performance identical to the wireless mode but you need to make sure they are powered on, if you listen in passive mode performance is not so good. The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones sport 8 microphones and the call quality is good and is excellent on zoom calls or phone meetings. It rejects outside noise well. Overall these Sony headphones are a great buy but expensive, but if you want the best they are definitely worth the outlay.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Cessnatim \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"So far, so good.\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 11, 2022\", \"content\": \"These are an early Christmas present for me, the first over-ear wireless headphones I\\u2019ve had, chosen because of the reviews testifying to very good sound quality, good noise cancellation, comfort and battery staying power. I\\u2019ve had them a couple of weeks and have used them most days, mainly in the evening but occasionally walking around doing things in the house - not used them outside. Mostly I\\u2019ve listened to music but I\\u2019ve heard a couple of podcasts too. The sound quality is lovely - the effects of tracks from Jean Michel Jarre where sound switches from one side to the other and back is reproduced brilliantly and the delicate background noises of trees rustling and goats on tracks recorded outside by Ballake Sissoko playing kora are fabulous. The human voice is a rich sound too, again with no apparent loss with even breathing audible on tracks where it was meant to be heard. Battery life seems very good. They arrived with about 60% charge and I recharged them when they got down to about 20% but that took about 10-14 days\\u2019 use of maybe 2 hours a day. No idea whether that\\u2019s good in comparison to others but certainly good enough for me. The set up was easy, noise cancellation is excellent from what I can make out, but I find the ability to pause this temporarily to head what someone is saying to me particularly helpful - just hold a hand over the right earpiece, ambient sound is restored very quickly and clearly, remove the hand and the music resumes. The headphones are comfy to wear, easy to adjust and while not tight, they seem to stay out so far when I\\u2019m bending down. The only very minor negative is that my ears get quite warm after I\\u2019ve worn them for about 1-2 hours, so I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019d want them on for really extended periods. But that would be the same or worse for all headphones so no difference for these and I suspect other models might not be as comfortable. It\\u2019s true there are no free lunches and you get what you pay for, but with these I feel I\\u2019ve got good value for money. They come in a protective case which also contains the charging cable, and the app might be useful for connoisseurs wanting to tweak the set up but I\\u2019ve just used them with my music app on the phone. So, I\\u2019d say so far, so good.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Jeff Foot \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}]",

Packaging: Everything comes included in a small box, right away you can tell that the packaging was very well thought out and designed. Included in the box: Is a USB-A to USB-C cable, an upgrade to the older micro USB-B cable, so I liked that. Also inside the box you will find three different tips that are placed on the earbuds themselves, they come in small, medium and large, already installed are the medium sized ones, These fit the best for me. Also included are \\u201cbands\\u201d these bands wrap around the earbuds themselves. Basically what they do is they form a seal around your ear, These serve two purposes 1. they seal out outside noises out, and 2. They make the earbud fit perfect perfectly inside of your ear canal to protect against the ear buds falling out. Pairing: Connecting the earbuds to my smart phone was really easy, just press the button in the back of the charging case for a couple of seconds, pair them with your smart phone, and that\\u2019s it. Pretty standard and pretty easy. App: You\\u2019ll soon be prompted to download the Bose app. I Recommend everybody do this for couple of reasons, you can play around with the sound EQ settings, you can know exactly how much charge your earbuds have, you can program and swap different shortcuts, and the app can show you very well detailed tips on how to work your new earbuds, meaning it\\u2019ll show you how to pause your music, skip to the next song and raise or lower the volume by simply touching the side of the earbuds with your finger. Finally the thing I appreciate most about this app is that it doesn\\u2019t require you to create any kind of account if you don\\u2019t want to. Sound: The sound is as good as I have ever heard earbuds sound, clean, crisp, excellent highs, excellent mids, and the bass is good enough (these are not super bass heavy) there\\u2019s not much else to say really, these just sound great. Noice Cancelling: Perhaps the single greatest feature of these earbuds have is their sound canceling ability. When in \\u201cQuiet\\u201d mode, The earbuds block out sound better than any earbuds I have ever tried before, then there\\u2019s \\u201cAware\\u201d turn this on if you still want to listen to your music but still be able to hear outside noises (like if you are out in the street and still want to hear cars coming) I think what happens here is the microphone gets turned on and you\\u2019re then able to then hear the outside noises this way, kind of like a hearing aid. Both Quiet mode and Aware mode work very well. Conclusion: I recommend Bose\\u2019s newest earphones to anybody that is reading my review and interested in this product, you will be happy with your purchase. I highly recommend downloading the app and downloading the newest software update for them for the best experience. + Sound + Design + Features +App +The Bands +Comfortable +Battery life -Charging case is made of plastic and feels somewhat cheap\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Ernesto \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:15845363056501127493_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjczfWhiJD-AhWJFlkFHYCCCI4QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Outstanding BOSE sound quailty\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"September 6, 2022\", \"content\": \"We\\u2019ve used a few earbuds in the past, always different brands and were never totally satisfied with the sound quality, \\u201cespecially me with some hearing issues\\u201d. Bose has come out with a new model of the Quietcomfort earbuds, the \\u201cII\\u201d model was just released, and we decided to give them a try. Unboxing and setup: The earbuds come in a very small Bose logoed box, and inside there\\u2019s a charger case, \\u201cwith the earbuds nestled inside\\u201d, a USB C charging cable, sm/lg eartips, sm/lg stability bands \\u201cthe medium was already on the buds\\u201d, a quick start guide and a small but surprisingly thick manual in multiple languages. The first thing I did was to plug in the charging cable \\u201chave plenty of USB C ones already so didn\\u2019t bother with the OEM one, let them charge up and proceeded to start syncing. We also installed the Bose Music Android App before proceeding. Synching on our Samsung phones was simple, just open the lid to the charger, press the button on the back of the case/charger so the blue light blinks on the front then search/pair on your phone. Once we did that and the Bose app found them it immediately showed there was an update, so we let that proceed \\u201cwhich does take a few minutes so just be patient\\u201d. After the earbuds were paired it was time to try them out. Now these buds are a little larger than the Samsung ones we have \\u201cnot by much\\u201d and they do stick down a little more than them too, but once you find your fit they are just as comfortable \\u201cmaybe a little bit better IMO\\u201d, they didn\\u2019t feel like they were going to fall out easily and the app has a test you can run to be sure they are seated correctly. I do like to that they don\\u2019t actually turn on till one of them \\u201cright for us\\u201d is inserted and then you\\u2019ll hear the voice prompt confirming and battery charge. Use: We were both totally blown away by the sound quality, there\\u2019s even plenty of bass for us, and having any bass in a earbud is a pretty tough feat. Naturally it\\u2019s not chest pounding bass but it\\u2019s more than enough to give the feeling of nice deep bass, and that\\u2019s adjustable in the EQ of the App. We also like that you can adjust the noise cancellation can be adjusted from 0 \\u201cnone\\u201d to 100 \\u201cmax cancellation\\u201d, with it turned up to 100 I couldn\\u2019t make out what my wife was saying standing right in front of me, the same with her when she was wearing them, which was a little odd but easily adjusted so you can at least make out some background noise. These would be perfect in a very noisy environment as long as you don\\u2019t need to hear what\\u2019s going on around you. There are also multiple presets \\u201cmodes\\u201d that you can pick from and even customize your own. There\\u2019s also a setting in the noise cancellation that uses what BOSE calls \\u201cActive Sense\\u201d, it\\u2019s under the \\u201cAware\\u201d mode, and it will adjust the cancellation for loud noises so it will protect your hearing from very loud noises. It actually worked pretty well when I ran the vacuum cleaner, I could tell the sound was muffled but as soon as I turned it off I could hear the background noises again, \\u201cpretty neat\\u201d. I went outside and did some light yard work and only once did one of the buds come out a little, and that caused the sound to pause, so you know it\\u2019s not inserted correctly, an easy slight twist put it right back in. I contributed that to sweat running around my ears as it was 108F out and after a few minutes out in that anyone is going to be sweating. I\\u2019ve never had earbuds fit as well as these, most of the time I would just quit using them halfway through a project as they kept popping out due to sweat. As for call quality, neither of us had issues hearing calls, everyone said they heard us clearly and even with my hearing issues I could easily make out what everyone was saying. I will say I wish the equalizer could be adjusted for each earbud individually. My right ear is my troublemaker, and it would be nice to be able to adjust the equalizer separately so I could fine tune them. These actually sound much better than my Siemens hearing aids, and they don\\u2019t cost nearly as much. Listening to music is no compairson with them, and I usually use a full headphone to get full sound with the Bose I can get the same effect. The controls are easy to use, the outside of the main piece that sticks out \\u201csort of a oblong pill shape\\u201d , is the touch sensitive control. You can swipe up/down for volume, tap twice to advance track, three taps reverses and one tap pauses, pretty simple. You can answer calls with a single tap, and The only issue I had there is the touch area is very sensitive and it\\u2019s very easy to bump when you reach up to adjust the buds or try a function. Grabbing them gently by the sides and not bumping the touch sensitive area can be a little difficult at times but I\\u2019m sure it just takes some practice, but you have to be careful till you get used to them. Conclusion: We\\u2019ve never owned earbuds that actually sound as good as these, and the noise cancellation is simply amazing. I find myself wearing these most of the day as they are comfortable enough to forget you are wearing them, \\u201cI just have to remember not to have the noise cancellation up too high or I\\u2019ll never hear my wife calling for me, vice versa too\\u201d. If you are looking for a premium set of earbuds, and yes they do cost more than others but you are getting BOSE sound quality that goes with that. I won\\u2019t be using any of my other buds as they will just not stand up to these in any way that I can see, and for me, the sound quality is just unmatched.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"SteveC \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:15845363056501127493_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjczfWhiJD-AhWJFlkFHYCCCI4QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Very good, although not quite perfect\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 8, 2022\", \"content\": \"Having used a variety of over-ear headphones and earbuds of varying budgets (\\u00a3\\u00a3 to \\u00a3\\u00a3\\u00a3), wired and wireless, I wasn't quite sure what to expect with the Bose QC II Earbuds. Took me a while to get them fitting how I liked, especially as the fitment was different to the usual wired earbuds I've used for years, with the ear canal piece being more rectangular than circular. Eventually got them sitting right and the fitment does actually feel better than what I've been used to. Saying that, I often get this little nagging feeling that the left earpiece is going to come loose, and yet it's very much firmly in place if I try to move it about. Tried various combinations of the different sized accessories with no real improvement, but it's a minor quibble, especially as I've used these for home workouts successfully; they've certainly never come close to falling out or anything like that. Noise-cancelling is decent. A lot is made of how class-leading these are in that respect, and I certainly don't think they're anything less than very good in that department, but in terms of blocking out outside noise when there's no audio playing, I don't think they're a clear step-up over what I've been used to. Audio quality is good; definitely an improvement over my various pairs of earbuds I've had, although no better than a pair of popular wireless headphones I have, but then those have much larger drivers, so perhaps an unfair comparison. Only mentioning because I saw someone mention elsewhere that they replaced their OE headphones with a pair of earbuds, and I don't think I'd be doing that myself; these QC IIs are very much for situations where bigger headphones aren't really suitable, such as going outside or exercising/running etc. Bluetooth connection/App seems stable, not had any connectivity issues so far. Actually went into the garage and forgot to take my phone with me, but the signal was still fairly stable, even though I was quite some distance from the source and had several doors/buildings blocking the signal potentially, so I'd have no concerns about dropouts in normal usage, impressive in that regard. Touch controls are simple and effective, although the pause/resume function does \\\"feel\\\" a bit laggy, but that may well be to do with ensuring pausing/resuming gestures aren't mixed up with the next/previous track function. Not a big deal as audio stops promptly if you tap the earbuds, I just have to remind myself to give them a few seconds to resume when I tap them again. I do wish there was a little audio beep or something when adjusting the volume as there is with my headphones. Although speaking of volume, these do need to be at a higher volume level than what I'm used to with other headphones/earbuds that I wear.

I have gone through a number of ear buds from a range of companies some premium and some more mainstream and always found the sound quality lacking in earbuds style as opposed to over ear designs. When I received my earbuds they were well packaged as you would expect the card case separates to reveal the various components of buds, case, cable and varying size buds and surround seals to ensure a good fit within the ear. As always frustratingly having opened the box everything needs charging so no fun for the first night! Within the pack is the QR code to download the Bose software for both IOA and android devices. Once charged and with software installed the setup was incredibly easy, it found the buds without having to go to settings find devices add pairing codes etc they just connected and then the software guided through the fitting phase to ensure the correct buds and surrounds were fitted. The sound test suggested everything was good to go. WOW was my first impression of sound quality, these little buds really had some good bass, within the app there is an equaliser which lets you change the base mid and treble and I am the sort of person that loves more Bass and Treble. these earbuds did not disappoint in sound quality for sure. Next came the programming of tap which in comparison to other models is more limited as there is basically a choice of which ear for the two settings, double taps, long taps etc are not catered for in this part of the app. The next test was for noise counselling which I have only ever found work fully on over the ear designs at premium prices. The noise cancellation in a normal environment is actually really good for these, it does not cancel everything but it certainly makes a difference and more so than other buds I have had in the past from premium brands. The only fault I have found is when cycling or running in wind conditions this is replicated as white noise slightly while listening to music. I think the only thing I have been disappointed with is the inability to charge the case wirelessly unless I have an incompatible charger this is not a feature of these earbuds as there was no evidence of charging no matter how I laid down the case and this is something I assumed would be the case. Overall these are the best earbuds I have owned so far, they compare with other brands but will still not beat over the ear!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"GEG87 \\u00b7 Review provided by bose.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:15845363056501127493_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjczfWhiJD-AhWJFlkFHYCCCI4QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Another flagship wireless earbuds from Bose\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"December 28, 2022\", \"content\": \"Designing appearances: First of all, the improvement of the charging box is particularly obvious. The charging box of Bose QC Earbuds II returns from the jewelry box style of the previous generation to the design direction of the mainstream TWS earphone charging box, resulting in a smaller size. What's more interesting is that the battery life of the charging box of Bose QC Earbuds II has been upgraded in spite of the reduced size! Wearing experience: The earplugs have undergone substantial alterations. Bose QC Earbuds II divided the previous generation of fish fin earplugs into two sections, the eartips and the stability bands, and called it \\\"Fit Kit ear kit\\\" The meaning of the Fit Kit is to solve the problem of ear fit for different users. You may encounter a certain type of noise-canceling earphones that are recognized as excellent in noise-canceling, but it feels average when it comes to you. The reason for this is probably that the earphones are not well adapted to your ear shape. After all, everyone's ear shape is different, and many people even have differences between their left and right ears. Noise-cancelling capability: Everyone who is familiar with the working principle of noise-cancelling headphones knows that the headphones will analyze and collect sound waves from the external environment, and create a reverse sound wave in the ear to cancel. The current flagship noise-cancelling headphones on the market perform very well in this regard. The Bose QC Earbuds II went a step further on this basis, focusing on the part of the ear, and made a smart in-ear sound field adjustment technology. When you insert the earbuds, you will hear a tone, which means that the smart in-ear sound field adjustment is working. At this time, it will automatically analyze the structure of the wearing ear canal, and then optimize the noise cancellation effect and sound quality of the earphones, thereby realizing \\\"volume customization\\\". Sound quality: The official description, the sound concept of Bose QC Earbuds II is balanced. After actual listening, I personally think it is true. The first impressions are incredibly supple and enduring. Each of the three frequency bands is fairly orderly, and nobody is trying to steal the show. Summarize: If you are looking for noise reduction and wearing comfort, Bose QC Earbuds II will not disappoint you!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"JC \\u00b7 Review provided by johnlewis.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:15845363056501127493_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjczfWhiJD-AhWJFlkFHYCCCI4QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"A music producers opinion\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"March 15, 2023\", \"content\": \"After ditching my old amazon bought earbuds and wearing over the had headphones for the better part of a year or so, I finally decided to get myself new earbuds. After about a month of research into what's on offer today I decided to use the 90-day risk free trial that is offered directly from Bose and go for the QC2, which are easily one of the most expensive earbuds you can buy, so do you get what you pay for? Yes. But here is my breakdown of all the features, from someone who has been producing and making music in studios for over a decade, I know a little thing or two about sound. So here goes. The Fit: Having the option between 3 different ear tip buds and 3 different wing bands leaves you with a good amount of choice in finding the fit that works for you, initially I found a good fit and the earbuds stay pretty firm in my ears for the most part. They have yet to actually fall out but I do find myself adjusting the left earbud quite frequently, as I get the feeling that it's going to fall out. This is quite annoying but manageable, and will be different for each user. I'm confident you'll find a good enough fit. The earbuds are comfortable for long periods of time and I have worn them for working out and they do stay put, but again, I find myself adjusting them a bit. Overall 4/5. The sound: I was expecting great things from the sound but overall, it is okay. It certainly isn't the best I've experienced, but certainly not the worst. The tuning is very well balanced I think, and there's no unusual emphasis on the Bass which is what a lot of companies tend to do so you get a fairly equal sound. I do sometimes find the high ends to be a bit harsh, particularly when listening to distorted guitar solos (Metallica, Megadeth etc) but this isn't too often. I do wish the sound would go louder though, My old earbuds would go very loud before hitting that phone sound warning that said you are in hearing loss territories but the QC2 don't go very loud before hitting that threshold, I find myself on the highest setting before the mark which is annoying because sometimes you want that loudness. This is probably my biggest gripe in terms of the sound, as a musician I appreciate the overall balance that these earbuds provide, but again, for the absolute best sound experience there are probably better earbuds out there. Overall 4/5 The noise cancelling and aware mode: Easily the best noise cancelling I've personally ever experienced. The quiet mode setting, truly gets rid of the outside world, it is remarkable. I can walk down the street with the setting enabled, with cars roaring passed me and I barely notice they are there, I'm focused on the sound on my ears which is an absolute blessing. The aware mode, which simulates Apples transparency mode is okay, I find there to be quite a bit of unnatural white noise which can become a bit tiresome after a while but overall it does a decent job. It also has an automatic feature which dampens loud sound around you (for example a door slamming) which is quite cool, but feels a bit weird. The noise cancelling though? Excellent. Overall 5/5 The app: I'm really not the biggest fan of the app. It's plain, boring, uninspired and you really don't get a lot from it. There's some tips and 'tricks' on there that really just tell you how to get the best fit for your ears etc. It let's you set two more custom noise settings (letting you adjust the level of noise cancelling and aware mode levels.) There's an EQ which lets you adjust the Bass, Mids, and Highs on the earbuds but you only get 3 bands which compared to other sound apps (JBL for instance) is quite terrible. If you want to adjust the sound I would recommend using a separate app with more customising options. Most of the time I find the earbuds cannot connect to the app anyway and without the connection, you are unable to do anything on the app, rendering it completely useless. Overall once you've had a look at the app, set your EQ preferences and set your noise modes, you won't be using it much and it's quite forgettable. Overall I'd give these earbuds a 4/5. With a good fit, good sound, great noise cancelling and and okay app these earbuds are certainly up there in terms of what you can buy. I do however think they are overpriced. I personally just do not think they are that good to be charging one of the highest prices on the market for earbuds, if you can get these discounted then certainly go for it but at full price, I do think there are probably pretty good cheaper alternatives. If you're main buying point is noise cancelling though, you probably want to take the plunge on these though. Do I regret buying them? No, they are good. But think carefully about how much you are willing to spend.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"DJN \\u00b7 Review provided by bose.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:15845363056501127493_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjczfWhiJD-AhWJFlkFHYCCCI4QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Best noise cancelling\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 9, 2022\", \"content\": \"These are the best noise cancelling earbuds, I have owned Jabra, Samsung, and Sony earbuds also. These have such good noise cancelling that my wife came behind me while I was doing dishes talking to my and said I could hear her and was just pretending I couldn't hear her, but I really couldn't hear her..... Now for the negative, my wife owns a dog training business and there are a lot of dogs that bark, it does a good job blocking out the barking except the very high pitches which you hear a popping sound, which I heard from interference with certain manufacturer machines that have a high pitch sound also. I do dislike how the left earbud is slave to the right earbud, which means you can't use the earbuds independently, with the right earbud being the master bud. But hopefully they will fix this with a futures update. But what I do LOVE and these earbuds is that I can pause, play, volume up/down, move track forward/backwards, and move between the different ANC seeing simultaneously with the right earbud. This is a phenomenal feature that I believe these are the only earbuds that have. They have definitely improved the Bass in this version and have superior sounds (Sony XM4's still have the best drivers but not much of a difference between these and Don't). Case size is normal for this price range, the obly 2 downsizes is no wireless charging (which I normally never use) and that the earbuds are not magnetic, sometimes they don't get a good connection to charge, but doesn't happen too often). People do complain about the eartip design, which does take a little to get use to, but after having it for a couple weeks, it does help with the ANC. As far as it's shape, I LOVE it. The XM4's, Samsung, and Jabras I would accidently be pressing the buttons taking the earbuds in and out, with these I can mess with them without worrying, which is a stress relieve. Battery life, they are not as good as Jabras, which have the best battery life I have tried yet, but after Jabra, they are are average for the price range. They ANC does drain the battery but as much as other brands, but worth it for how good the ANC is. Price range, the price is about right for what you are getting. Final words, they are the best wireless earbuds I have owned out of multiple brands for what I need. If you want best sound quality, go with the Sony XM4'S the 2022 version, not the /B version (which is having battery drain issues right now due to firmware update). If you want top of the line earbuds in budget I would go with either Jabra or Samsung, which both are GREAT earbuds. But the BOSE have THE BEST ANC, have all controls on the right earbud, great sound quality, and come from a good company. Do they have everything I want? NO, but I won't find an earbud that does. Do I sometimes question these earbuds, yes. Would I buy these again, in a heartbeat. So if you want an overall top of the line for earbuds, these are great! The only reason that I don't give them 5 stars is due to the periodically popping sound, which other earbuds have also (Sony, Dr. Dre) but should be able to be fixed in a software update, which when that happens I will give 5 stars and I am a rough at rating, my wife can tell you that.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"techsavy \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:15845363056501127493_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjczfWhiJD-AhWJFlkFHYCCCI4QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Don't buy Bose at any cost!\", \"rating\": 1, \"date\": \"January 7, 2023\", \"content\": \"I originally bought the Quiet Comfort earbuds in January 2022 which needed replacing and repair about 4 times in a few months (which obviously took up A LOT of time with the admin of talking to JL and going into store etc), until the last time they got sent away where I was told there'd be a week turn around to receive another new pair. Fast forward 6 weeks and they're still 'in progress'. Had to speak to JL (and Bose) directly to find out they had no stock to send my replacement. I was about to give up and get a refund when I suggested I'd try the upgraded pair if JL would offer me that free of charge, which they kindly did (\\u00a330 difference). I received the QC II and had similar problems, left bud always draining of charge or not fully charging, the sound warping between both earbuds, the microphone picking up too much background noise so phone calls outside meant the recipient was not able to hear me, as well as trouble connecting to my phone on every start up, taking about 5-10 mins, putting them back in their case, restarting Bluetooth, opening and closing the app etc. Very inconvenient on the go. Alongside all these defects, the design was off for me. In order to scroll through various noise cancelling levels you can't just hold your finger on the earbud (which also, by the way, didn't fit in my ear properly so fell out multiple times, so-much-so I avoided wearing them when moving a lot), you have to press for ~2 seconds then release for ~2 seconds then press again etc to go through your various modes, which I felt was generally impractical and annoying, especially as it didn't respond to heavy touch but equally didn't with too light a touch. It also meant the right one was even more likely to fall out of my ear. It also made me look like a wannabe Spy. The noise cancelling also broke on the first few pairs I had, and a high pitched whining noise existed when not listening to music. To operate the volume control it requires a swipe, but it never seem to respond properly and would often pause my music or end the call I was on (which is actually the double tap function). All in all, it was a terrible purchase I wish I'd never made, but it was made slightly simpler by the fact the in-store John Lewis Tech team in Bristol made the return easy for me and were very helpful. I am now sworn off Bose for good (I also have a portable speaker which has connective and sound quality issues) but the silver lining is that I would purchase from JL again, knowing that my purchase was protected.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Kitty \\u00b7 Review provided by johnlewis.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:15845363056501127493_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjczfWhiJD-AhWJFlkFHYCCCI4QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"amazing sound quality. lacks some features\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"October 5, 2022\", \"content\": \"I rate these headphones a 4 out of 5 mainly because of the sound quality but I have a few things I'm disappointed in especially because of the price point. i really wish the bose name wasn't so large on the side of the earbud it's so distracting wish it was maybe smaller or on an edge. it has no wireless charging BUT that means it weighs less not an issue for me. there is no indication on the case that says anything about the battery and its a bigger case than other types of wireless earbuds but significantly smaller than past bose cases so that's good. there isnt a button that allows you to open the case which means that the case opens too easily also from my experience. the magnets don't really help the case stay closed. the process to pair it is a little difficult. first of all you have to have the app which i don't like and a lot of other wireless headphone don't need an app but if you want to customized your sound quality these are a great option.i like the ear buds that just pair with the phone by Bluetooth but this is definitely very technical The best part about these headphones is that they do live up to the Bose name in terms of noise canceling. It feels like it adjusts to the sound intensity. The quality of calling people is good also because it's very clear. I do agree that the charging time for the earbuds lasts about 6 hours with no issues. Again, you can customize the sound quality on the app. As most earbuds, these come with 3 different soft silicone ear tips and 3 stability bands but for the price I do think there need to be even more tip options for a good fit for everyone These look big in my ears but I was suprised they aren't heavy. I do wish that again for the price point that they would come with the option of over the ear holders too. It seems big but they do have a lot of features especially the swiping on the outside of the earbud wide portion that's unique and there's enough room for your finger to slide easily and a groove to know when to stop You do need to use certain functions on certain earbud and not that can be done on either one. The quiet and aware modes are unique and I'm glad there two options, you may need to play around to get used to them. I personally like the aware mode as it allows for more background noise to get in and I can still pay attention to other things, but there is an area you can change the noise cancelation and tailor it. I think you can only use the voice feature on the right earbud. you can't use one earbud independent of another at the moment uless you leave both outside the case but i did read it may become Available in an update. you also have to be careful with the amplifying power of these earbuds because some sounds are so loud in your ear. personally i do not walk around with earbuds i only use them to work out but would definitely not wear these all the time if I was looking for that option without removingsome of the noise canceling because its so intense almost like wearing earplugs. PLEASE add a find my earbud feature to the app it's really needed!

You know it's working as each bud plays a short note before announcing the device it's paired with, and that announcement goes from being a tad muffled to crystal-clear in the space of a second or less, as the NC is adjusted. Sound Quality The Bose buds have a beefy sound that's underpinned with solid bass, not muddy in any way. The top end can be shrill but is easily moderated with the in-app equalizer. The noise cancellation really helps by removing all distractions and allowing you to focus on the music, it might not be audiophile quality but it is very satisfying. Noise Cancelling Just amazing. I have a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 which were, until now, pretty much unbeatable. The Boses handily trump them. There is some hiss if you have them NC on with no music, in a quiet room, but in any other scenario they are a miracle made flesh, they simply erase what's going on around you better than any other headphone I've heard. The 'aware' mode is great too, people talk about the Apple Airpods Pro as having the best but these are in the same division, passed through noise sounds very natural and that mode doesn't make the music sound tinnier as some others I've heard do. Battery life Good, or rather, normal. 6 hours-ish plus 2 more charges from the case with NC on all the time. Fit and comfort Good, if unusual. There is a pack containing 3 sets of rings and 3 sets of ear tips, the rings help to hold the buds in place and form a seal, the tips do what tips normally do and you can get a perfect fit by mixing and matching them. The app has a sound test you can run to check if you have the best fit, which works perfectly. In my case the defaults were just fine. Once setup, they don't wobble or feel in any way loose Conclusion Amazing.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"ElleCee \\u00b7 Review provided by johnlewis.com\"}]",

\"title\": \"Enhanced Listening Experience\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"March 21, 2023\", \"content\": \"I recently upgraded to the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) in White, and I am genuinely impressed with their performance, comfort, and features. Straight out of the box, the AirPods Pro have a sleek and modern design that stands out. The compact charging case is incredibly portable and fits easily into my pocket or bag, making it convenient to carry around. One of the standout features of the 2nd generation AirPods Pro is the active noise cancellation. It effectively blocks out ambient sounds, allowing me to fully immerse myself in my music or podcasts without distractions. The transparency mode is equally impressive, as it lets me stay aware of my surroundings when needed, making it perfect for outdoor activities or commuting. The AirPods Pro have an ergonomic design, featuring interchangeable silicone ear tips that provide a secure and comfortable fit. The snug fit ensures that they stay in place, even during vigorous workouts, without causing any discomfort. Sound quality is excellent, with clear audio and a well-balanced profile that caters to various music genres. The adaptive EQ feature automatically adjusts the audio to suit my personal preferences, ensuring an optimal listening experience every time. Battery life has been reliable, with up to 4.5 hours of listening time on a single charge and up to 24 hours with the charging case. The quick charging feature is a lifesaver when I'm in a hurry, providing around an hour of listening time with just a few minutes of charging. If I had to point out a drawback, it would be the premium price tag. However, considering the top-notch audio quality, noise cancellation, and other advanced features, I believe the investment is well worth it. To sum it up, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) deliver an exceptional listening experience with their comfort, sound quality, and advanced features. If you're looking for a versatile and reliable pair of true wireless earbuds, I highly recommend giving the AirPods Pro a try.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"LeviD \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/6883422599141817139/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:7977644765926870946_0,pid:11263843156781472965,rsk:PC_13143994692656166675&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz9OahiJD-AhVZElkFHXfHBU8QqSQIcg\", \"title\": \"Life-changing earbuds?\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"January 14, 2023\", \"content\": \"I can definitely see why folks are skeptical of $250 earbuds, there are certainly less expensive options out there that will work, some of them with cool features like transparency and noise cancelling. Some might even have better sound quality, style, and comfort...However it's what makes the AirPods Pro different that makes them special and indispensable. What sets the AirPods Pros apart is how well they work across your iCloud-connected devices, without having to un-pair and re-pair. Like magic, whatever Apple device you happen to be looking at is what your AirPods Pro are connected to! \\\"it just works\\\" as they say. Want to listen to a quick TikTok or take a call in a public place? Pop in an AirPod and have fun! You'll wonder how you lived without them! With a simple press and hold of the stem, they'll toggle between transparency and noise cancelling modes. Transparency is quite natural, effectively eliminating background noise while allowing you to hear important things like cars and sirens in the wild while still able to clearly hear your content; pausing your content, you'll be able to carry on a conversation with someone close by. The noise cancelling is some of the best I've ever heard, blocking out more noise than my Bose QC35-II and Sony XM4 cans; It's simply amazing. Finally, the Spacial Audio feature is really cool, but kind of gimmicky...I'm glad it's there, however because combined with transparency, a convincing \\\"illusion\\\" can be created where the device in front of you is playing sound, but only you can hear it. And all of that is great if you're all-in on the Apple ecosystem...If you have non-Apple devices, honestly it's probably best to look elsewhere for those devices. But like all things Apple, AirPods Pro really shine inside the walled garden. And if you're debating upgrading from the first-gen AirPods Pro to the new ones, I'd say wait for a sale. First-gen are still pretty great, and while the second-gen is even better, it's not a difference worth paying full price for.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"mykie242 \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/6883422599141817139/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:7977644765926870946_0,pid:11263843156781472965,rsk:PC_13143994692656166675&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz9OahiJD-AhVZElkFHXfHBU8QqSQIcg\", \"title\": \"Better innvovation and a leap foward\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"December 19, 2022\", \"content\": \"This has been my most compelling purchase in a long time! Apple just took audio integration to the next level. There are 4 major reasons to upgrade your AirPods to the pro gen 2. Its important to upgrade your iPhone with IOS 16.0 or higher in order to realize the benefits of these earbuds. Without this update you will not have access to adaptive transparency or the new spatial audio so before testing make sure you do this step. 1. Sound - The clarity and detail these produce is astounding, especially with the new custom spatial audio activated, but we will get to that later. Bass - sub frequencies now extend all the way down to 20 hz vs the gen 1s 40 hz so it goes low! Not only is it lower but it\\u2019s a lot more present, they finally gave these buds the oomph they needed to compete with the top tier wireless audio! They simply cover a better range of sound when listening and offer a more complete listening experience. I use Spotify almost exclusively and with some tweaks in the Spotify 6 ban EQ I actually prefer this sound profile over my Sennheiser MTW3 earbuds which are widely regarded as some of the best sounding earbuds on the market. 2. Adaptive transparency - The Adaptive transparency feature has been such a game changer for me. Basically it filters out any loud sounds over 95 DB and automatically lowers that sound to match everything else you hear. This does not sound like that big of a deal but for those of us who use earbuds for several hours a day in noisy environments it changes the game. No more worrying about the deafening jolt of a dog barking, or a car honking in transparency mode, the new H2 chip lets you hear your environment as if you had no earbuds on at all, very natural and without the worries of yesterdays deafening surprises. 3. Spatial audio - This might be the feature that surprised me most only because the older version of spatial audio did not do much and had very few applications to use it with. With the new update this version of spatial audio is such a substantial improvement it cannot be overstated. Apple has a customizable feature for spatial audio when you hold the phone about 10 inches from your ear the LiDAR scans your ear canal in order to figure out the proper sound implementation. I know it sounds very gimmicky, but it actually works very well. I am now a believer. I went from watching an occasional movie with the old version to now almost exclusively leaving the spatial audio on. It adds an incredible amount of soundstage and depth! So not just hearing voice and instrumental separation from left to right but also you can distinguish sounds from front to back as well. And this works for music but it noticeably changes my podcasts also. It sounds like your actually in the room listening live now! Try the song Bubbles by Yosi Horikawa it will blow your mind!! 4. ANC - Considering how light and comfortable the gen 2s are I\\u2019m deeply impressed with how much noise is filtered out. It eliminates the all lower frequencies like AC or a treadmill and it brings voices down to a very slight whisper. Even while listening to a podcast when ANC is activated you will not hear anything else around you. It\\u2019s a marked improvement over my MTW3. Other improvements - The Case has a speaker now and let\\u2019s you track it within a foot when lost, just open the find my app and it will guide you with an arrow to where the case is. Full Siri integration, you can use Siri for everything from turning on Transparency mode, or ANC, to playing music, to listening and sending messages, weather updates, making calls ect. You can be 100% hands free the whole day if you wanted to be. Volume button - finally apple! now you can slide up or down on either earbud stem for volume control, it feels awkward at first but you get use to it quickly. I will update with any issues if I run into with them but as of now I can\\u2019t think of a single flaw these have other then maybe the lack of color options. If you have an iPhone these are a must! Let me know if this helps.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Ally \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/6883422599141817139/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:7977644765926870946_0,pid:11263843156781472965,rsk:PC_13143994692656166675&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz9OahiJD-AhVZElkFHXfHBU8QqSQIcg\", \"title\": \"Truly Amazing ANC\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"October 14, 2022\", \"content\": \"I've used a lot of different kinds of headphones and I've admitted that the first gen airpods stole my heart and I haven't looked back since.

When I saw the improvements on these I was too tempted to pass them up. They sound better than my regular Airpods and I like the ability to have more variety of controls. There was just double tap on left and right for the regular version. I had my left one set to play/pause and right to go to the next track. On the Pro 2 it took some getting used to squeezing instead of tapping, but now I can squeeze once to play/pause, twice for next track or 3 times for previous track. These also have the ability to adjust volume by sliding your fingertip up or down the flat part of the stem. It took some getting used to too, but now it's easy. Spatial audio is a cool feature too, but not one that sold me on these. It's just a plus, not something that I would spend extra for. I like the Adaptive Transparency, though I need to fine tune it. Unlike my cheap brand of earbuds, the adaptive transparency seems to filter out most wind noise instead up just amplifying it so that the feature was useless in the wind on the cheap brand. I haven't tried riding my bike in these yet, but walking down the street with wind doesn't blast my ears out. It comes with several tips for different ear sizes, though I'm just using the ones it started me with. I don't know how much difference it makes, but it had me sweep my camera across my ears to get an awareness of the shape of them and adjust the audio for me specifically. That was cool, but I didn't use them without it for comparison. I like that I can see them or the case in my Find My app too in case I need to locate them. I also like that this case can charge wirelessly as opposed to my non pro Airpods and the speaker is nice to let me know when they start charging. And these last almost through my whole workday before needing a charge. Even then, they charge up a lot in a short period of time, so I can just plug in for a few minutes to make it through the rest of the workday. It's a splurge for sure with them being overpriced, but if you have some extra and like the ease of the ecosystem it's a good purchase.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"xtwentyseven \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/6883422599141817139/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:7977644765926870946_0,pid:11263843156781472965,rsk:PC_13143994692656166675&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz9OahiJD-AhVZElkFHXfHBU8QqSQIcg\", \"title\": \"Audio quality blew my mind\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"October 19, 2022\", \"content\": \"I honestly didn\\u2019t think I needed these until I finally got them. And I only got them because I needed new headsets (or earphones) for work, but I also didn\\u2019t want to spend that much money for the AirPod Max. The moment I tried these on for the first time, the audio quality blew my mind. It took about two weeks getting used to them because they hurt my ears regardless of earplug size. Once I finally broke into them, I could wear them comfortably for hours. The adaptive transparency feature is definitely something you don\\u2019t think you need until you finally use it. There are plenty of articles online explaining all of their features, so I\\u2019m not going to deep dive into that. I will say, connecting to a Mac is seamless, I love that it recognizes when I pull them out and pauses streaming music/videos. I use them during zoom meetings at work, and my audio (and voice) is always clear. Coworkers can\\u2019t even hear my background noise. Battery life for the earphone could use some improvement, but from what I\\u2019ve been reading, using transparency or noise canceling causes it to drain faster. Note to those who use Logitech MX keys and mouse. You\\u2019ll need to use the unifying receiver with the peripherals because these AirPods don\\u2019t play nice with other Bluetooth devices (too much interference). My coworkers said my voice sounded robotic like a transformer during my zoom meetings. The only solution was to switch those peripherals from Bluetooth to unifying USB receiver, which was a bummer because I didn\\u2019t want to use up two USB ports. Other than that, I 100% recommend these if you don\\u2019t mind spending that much.

I purchased the Apple AirPods Pro 2nd generation before being able to test them in ear. I had heard some of the pre release reviews and liked what I was hearing from the reviews so I took the plunge and ordered through the apple website on release day. I won\\u2019t do a super deep dive into all the specs and experiences. I will sum it up the best I can. The earbuds are aesthetically appealing and provide that recognizable apple design to anyone who glances over. It feels premium and has many fittings that allow the ear bud to fit well in most anyone\\u2019s ear. My daughter uses mine quieter often by switching out the earpiece to a smaller size. It works ok for working out but not the ideal earbud of hitting the treadmill. The interaction /connection between IPhone and earbud is near instant. The battery lasts a good amount of time, there is much to like. In terms of sound, the spatial audio seems gimmicky, not sure that anyone will find it revolutionary. The sound quality is ok at best. At the price point there are other brands that have better overall clarity and dynamics. I like to listen to my audio at high levels, the AirPods Pro don\\u2019t allow me to get as loud as I like. Probably something to do with their health app and monitoring loud noises\\u2026.not sure but I can\\u2019t rock out as much as I would like. The ANC (active noise cancelling) is better than Gen 1 but again, other brands at this price point do it better. I wear a lot of online meetings , virtual classes and situations where I am on speaker for larger groups. I have been told that my wired earbuds from many years ago sound a bit clearer than my new AirPods. That may be a situational or isolated issue as many others have said they have good performance in those areas. Overall, it depends on what you are looking for in an earbud. If you want one for working out, there is a better option. If you want one for audiophile performance, there are better options. If you want the best ANC, there are better options. It may not be the best in any category but If you want an all rounder that does everything well.

\"title\": \"Better design, with worse...well, everything else\", \"rating\": 1, \"date\": \"October 11, 2022\", \"content\": \"I bought this 3 months ago, excited to upgrade from my previous Sony headphones. The design has definitely improved, and it feels sturdy despite the slimmer build. It folds flat, nice and compact in the equally sturdy case. There's USB-C support for charging, and it doesn't take too long to charge either -- but that's where the positives end. I'm a longtime fan of Sony headphones, but this pair is definitely my worst. Here's why: - The noise cancelling is really, really bad. I was patient and waited for Sony firmware updates, and while Sony did tweak some of the settings, none of the updates since June have done the headphones any good in terms of noise cancelling *quality*. Sure, the headphones can now automatically change noise cancelling intensity based on location and movement, but the changes are now so jarring and inconsistent, thus making the updates feel more like a massive downgrade. Here's a daily scenario: you walk to your bus stop, the headphones then switch to a different noise cancelling setting because it remembers that your local bus stop is a saved location (and if you haven't saved it, you'll receive an annoying amount of notifications for any of your regular locations, including any bus stops you're regularly at as part of your commute); you get on the bus, and the headphones change to a different noise cancelling intensity...but at every stop, your headphones think that you got off, so the automatic motion detection switches to \\\"walking mode\\\"...imagine this on a 10-stop bus commute, and the number of times your headphones switch from commuting-walking-commuting-walking-commuting... Then imagine the occasional stop because of traffic lights, the occasional roadwork, traffic... For some reason these headphones seem to think that \\\"commuting\\\" means \\\"non-stop fast travel from start to end\\\". Having to constantly tweak the settings on my commutes when I just want to relax and enjoy music or podcast or even just silence is definitely not a good start to the day. - These headphones will occasionally turn off for no reason. Sometimes they restart, sometimes they just turn off without restarting, adding to the endless list of disruptions that you can expect to experience while using these headphones. - It's great that you can easily control volume and playback by swiping on your earcups...so long as you don't rely on the option to connect two devices at a time -- a great feature, but one that often disables (for some odd reason) the ability to use gestures to control playback and volume. You'll never know when this happens, but I can assure you of this -- it *will* happen. - There's the option to use \\\"Spotify Tap\\\", with two open slots, both for the same feature (which is very odd): you can just switch from one Spotify playlist to another Spotify playlist...which one are you switching to? No idea, it just switches it to a random playlist...and I have no idea why this was added as a \\\"feature\\\". - Although Google Assistant is still advertised as a great feature for this pair...it's actually not available. Google have revoked this feature, and it's not even a new announcement, but for some reason Sony still advertises this as a selling point. - No worries if you still want to use a voice assistant function -- there's Alexa...which works...so long as you keep the app open...but if you have the app open on your phone, you may as well just use your phone while you're at it -- which leads me nicely to my final point: These headphones were not meant for you to listen to music or whatever form of entertainment you want to enjoy. These headphones were meant for you to use -- use the app to correct the frequent mistakes, constantly swipe across the earcups and press the buttons to fix the errors, regularly open the Sony app to tweak the settings of your noise cancellation, and hope that you won't have someone around you nudging you about how bad the sound is leaking from your headphones while the volume isn't even at 50%. These headphones are a huge step back for Sony -- sure, they packed a lot of innovation and great tech in it, but with the constant tinkering I've had to resort to these past few months, these headphones feel more like a really expensive gadget to with, and less like a pair of headphones.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"benkellis \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Unbelievable noise canceling! Excellent sound!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 24, 2022\", \"content\": \"If you're looking for the best active noise canceling, over-ear headphones... look no further! The quality of noise canceling is second to none, somehow, Sony has taken the best ANC headphones and improved the ANC! Okay, on to the review. The Sony WH-1000XM5s have amazing sound quality, a nice finish (the black does attract fingerprints, at least at first), very comfortable for extended wear, and easily adjustable. The only thing I wish would have been kept around is the ability to fold the headphones like the previous versions, the case for the XM5s is a bit bulky, but you can clip it to a backpack or slide it into a bag pretty easily. The case also holds an included USB-C charging cable and 3.5mm cable in a magnetically sealed compartment and covers the entirety of your high-end headphones, unlike some of Sony's competitors. The thinner headband is nice, I can't really speak to how it may affect one's hair, but it leaves a smaller headband imprint on my bald head and has a barely there feel to it. The earcups are very comfortable and have ample room, even for those with bigger ears! They retain some of the best features of Sony's other ANC headphones, such as: touch controls on the ear cup, cover-to-speak/hear ambient mode, ANC/Ambient/\\\"normal\\\" mode button, 3.5mm ability, highly adjustability in the Sony Headphones app, auto-mode switching based on activities. The ambient mode has the ability to focus on voices, instead of just the general ambient noise and the ability to adjust the level of the ambient noise let in is a very nice feature to have. Pairing that with the auto-mode switching and \\\"speak-to-chat,\\\" which switches the headphones to voice-focused ambient mode when you begin to speak and turns off after a predetermined (and adjustable) amount of time, make for an amazing set of headphones for working in the office, taking on flights, trains, busses, and walking around. Now, they are not claimed to be water or sweat-resistant or IP rated in any way, kind of a bummer on for headphones that seem as though they'd be a perfect pairing for running or working out, but most of the nicer headphones lack an IP rating. In my testing of them, they've held up to some pretty sweaty runs. I do dry them off immediately and leave them off and out of their case for about an hour afterwards and they look, sound, and function perfectly. Something that each individual will have to decide if they're willing to take that risk with such a nice set of headphones. Overall, I would definitely recommend the Sony WH-100XM5s to those looking for great audio quality for music, videos, and calls with amazing active noise cancelation for the times you wish to be isolated from outside noise. I could see these being a perfect fit for a frequent traveler, a music loving office worker looking to focus, and anyone who likes to head the world around them in excellent clarity while wearing their over-ear headphones! I am absolutely loving these and think they're worth the bump in price from the previous generation (XM4) by improving on the previous generation in all ways except for the ability to fold.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Mike \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Some stuff is good some stuff needs to be improved\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 3, 2022\", \"content\": \"The surface of the arch that fits your head is very thin, this looks good, but it makes it so that the point of contact in your head is minimal. Since only a small part of this surface touches your head, there is a lot of pressure on it, and after an hour, the top of my head starts hurting, and I have to move the ring around throughout the day to avoid this pain, which is very annoying. The headphone comes with sensors which detect if you have them on. It comes with an app where you can choose if to turn the headphones off when you take them off your head by using the sensor. This is amazing for saving batteries meaning you don't have to charge them often because you forgot to turn them off manually. The problem is you can choose a timer for the to turn off and turn off immediately after taking them off, making it very annoying when you want to take your headphones off for multiple reasons like going to the toilet, talking to someone else or simply moving them around to find a more comfortable position, they turn off and if you are in a meeting on slack or teams, skype you will have to go through the process of connecting a device to these apps again which is very annoying. On top of that, I like to put a hoodie on and the headphones on top simply because it makes me feel warm, but the sensor picks that I am not wearing the headphones properly and turns them off; this is super annoying too. The only solution is to turn the feature which turns the headphones off automatically and remember to turn them off manually myself which I always forget and end up having to charge them more often than I would like to. The solution would be to let us put a timer when they should turn off so I could conveniently set them up to turn after 5 minutes of having them off, but alternatively only allow them to turn off if there is no audio playing. This would make it so that I can take them off for short periods of time without having them turned off and so that I could wear them however I want them without turning them off as long as I am listening to music or on a call with someone else. The problem with the small contact point and the pain at the top of my head, well this is a design flaw and I do find myself not wearing them often on purpose if I don't have to due to the discomfort and instead play my laptop speakers. The noise cancelling and audio quality is superb and the ambient mode is decent. I have 10 days to keep them or return them, and I am leaning more towards returning them. Will see.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Rafacast7 \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"As advertised but missing some big basic features\", \"rating\": 3, \"date\": \"March 24, 2023\", \"content\": \"I found the reviews to be a bit too thorough as if they are paid advertisements that only echo online reviews by compensated individuals. The absence of any quick start guide was frustrating since I didn't have great cell coverage at the time I unboxed the headphones. I didn't know about the controls on the side and the app does not offer any guide either. I am still left in a maze to navigate their website in and out of hyperlinks to figure out which button or surface space does what. For an extremely high price these headphones are less about quality sound and more about noise canceling. If you like great audio, these aren't the headphones for you as they muffle and distort the sound. In general, noise canceling does that so that isn't a complete surprise. An astonishing and ridiculous issue I have with these headphones is that you CANNOT USE THEM WHILE THEY CHARGE?! In this era of device demand, this is a shockingly ignorant choice on the part of Sony. I get it, they might think since wireless earbuds can't be used while charging then who needs to listen to their headphones while they charge? Or perhaps they prioritized a fast charge over listening. The problem with that comes when you quick charge devices over and over again for short periods of time ruining the battery performance. Sony is practically begging you to do that by discouraging you from being able to listen to them at the same time as fully charging them. Overall I appreciate being able to drown out a good amount of background noise but I am left questioning if that's really worth the $400 price tag. If you are looking for noise canceling, pick a pair of great sounding earbuds and skip the actual noise canceling feature, just purchase some flight line ear protection headphones for a much better comfort and outside noise control. You'll save yourself hundreds while having a much lighter pair of headphones that doesn't overheat your ears. Another disappointment of mine was the erroneous idea that connecting to two devices at the same time would mean I could actually listen to two inputs at the same time. Perhaps Bluetooth isn't there yet through no fault of Sony, but I also felt the advertising was misleading on this particular feature and the answer was buried in Bluetooth spec and tech sites and not disclosed on the Sony site. I like that my phone can interrupt my business meeting playing from my computer but I dislike that I cannot listen to ambient sound on Pandora while participating in a business meeting at the same time. Since the audio can't be independently adjusted in noise volume by your individually connected device, you are left with a ring tone set to the same volume as your YouTube video or conversely the YouTube video resumes as loudly as the call and that is mildly annoying.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"AverageListener \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Great upgrade to an already great product\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"June 1, 2022\", \"content\": \"I purchased my first noise cancelling headphones in 2017 and, after a significant amount of research decided on the MDR-1000X. I have been extremely happy with the quality of these products to the extent that I then purchased my wife a pair of WH-1000XM3, the upgraded version of my headphones in 2019. We were both extremely happy with the design, comfort, ease of use and quality of the products. The main reason for purchasing them was for travelling, and making long-haul flights more enjoyable without the distraction of the plane and other background noises. The WH-1000XM5 are, however, a significant step up from these previous products. Firstly, the headphones feel significantly lighter, which is always a plus for travelling. The previous versions used to fold away into their carry case with a bit of twisting, which I always was worried about in case of getting it wrong, having to double check each time that I folded the correct ear. To be fair, it was easy enough, but with this pair, there is no need for this and they simply fold flat back into their case, which makes easier The carry case is a bit bigger, which therefore takes a bit more room in your hand luggage, but has room within it for all cabling (audio and charger), which is a good. I actually think the latest version are more comfortable as well - but it is marginal. I always felt noise cancelling was great on the previous product and it is equally so on the new version. The big plus for me is that there is now no need to run the noise cancelling optimiser for different surroundings. OK, it was fairly simple by pressing a button, but it took about a minute to complete. There is no need for this with the XM5's, as apparently they auto optimise based on your surroundings - which is great. There are other new features that you have to get used to: - the headphones automatically pause what you were listening to when you take them off, and restart when you put them back on - confusing at first when testing, when you think you must have pressed something by accident, but it is a feature which is quite useful - similarly, if you start speaking, the headphones recognise this, pause your music and switch to ambient mode so you can hear - ideal for when you are asked if you want a drink on the plane! Apparently you can pair the headphones to 2 devices simultaneously, in case you are listening to music on a laptop but want to still receive calls!? That is not really relevant for me, so I have not tried it. Battery life is claimed at 30 hours and a 10 minute charge apparently provides 5 hours of battery use. Again, I cannot validate these figures - but have not experienced any issues. In short, they charge quickly and last a long time! Sound quality is pretty important when buying headphones and this is where they come into their own, and I personally think they offer a much fuller sound than my original 1000X, with impressive bass. They are a real step up. In summary, these are really excellent headphones from every perspective and I was pleasantly surprised at how they improved on what I previously thought were perfectly adequate 1000X. I am very happy that I have the new ones, especially as now we can fly again so hopefully I will get chance to use them more often.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"GrenA \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"The BEST just got BETTER!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 27, 2022\", \"content\": \"Sony has done it yet again; they\\u2019ve actually improved upon what I feel are the BEST noise cancelling wireless over-ear headphones available! The WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are the newly released version from Sony and they have added even more user-friendly features and technology than the previous versions\\u2026and updated the look to a more modern design. What\\u2019s in the box - The headphones ship with a great zippered carrying case, a USB-C fast charging cable, an audio cable for wired connection and instructions/paperwork/360 Music offer. The headphones fold much easier compared to the previous versions. There is no more origami-like folding, just turn the ear cups and put them in the case\\u2026which is a good size for traveling. They fit perfectly in the outside pocket of my backpack. The earphones were fully charged out of the box, so all that\\u2019s needed to get started (optional really, as they headphones will connect to your Bluetooth device anyway) is download the Sony Headphones Connect app and set up the earphones. There was a software update available for the headphones and it updated once they were connected. Fit and Function - The first thing I noticed was the new sleeker, more modern looking and lighter design of the XM5s. Although the design has changed, the comfort level is as plush and comfortable as ever. The ear cups and headband are super plush and easy to adjust to your head size. I've been wearing them almost non-stop for the last couple of days and there are no hotspots or uncomfortable rubbing. Hold the power button for a couple of seconds and then the magic starts, the noise canceling technology is fantastic, literally cutting out all the background noise as I mowed the lawn, went running or just listening to music while working around the house (my wife texts me as I can't hear her!). With the Auto Switching Based on Action, the noise cancelling level adjusts to your activity and the outside noise. Sound Quality - The sound quality is the BEST I've ever heard from Bluetooth NC headphones. Straight out of the box these things rock, but the Headphone Connect app gives the user the ability to set custom preferences for sound and services. From a noise canceling perspective Sony touts 8 total microphones and a newly designed 30mm driver to provide optimized noise canceling performance. So the 1000XM5s provide industry leading noise canceling and music that is so crisp and clear on the highs and the bass is rich and deep. Quality sound as expected from Sony! Headphone Connect App - it's a great tool for taking advantage of the many settings these headphones provide like Adaptive Sound Control, Noise Canceling Optimizer, Surround, Equalizer, Sound Quality Mode, Voice Assist, etc. Open the app, turn on the headphones and hold them close to connect and you\\u2019re ready to customize the earphones. The app is broken into four sections: Status, Sound. System and Services. Some of the functions are automatic like the Adaptive Sound Control - this will detect your surroundings and adjust the headphones accordingly. You can also select the Noise Canceling levels. The System tab is all about the operational settings like Auto Power Off, Touch Sensors, etc. Super easy to use and a great tool that\\u2019s very well laid out for the user. Cool (and totally useful) Functions - Not only do these headphones rock, they are loaded with super cool and totally useful Touch Features so you can adjust the music level, FF, Pause, answer phone calls, etc. by simply touching the right ear cup. And if that isn't enough, Sony has upped the game by adding Speak-To-Chat which stops the music and let\\u2019s in ambient sound so you can hold a conversation without having to take the earphones off or cover the right earphone (which still works) as the previous version supported. The other new function that really stands out to me is the Automatic Off (Wearing Detection) feature. By simply taking the headphones off, music is instantly paused until they are put back on\\u2026then the music instantly starts up again automatically. Not sure how Sony will add more features to these headphones in the future\\u2026but I\\u2019m sure they will do something amazing! Phone Calls \\u2013 Sound is great both on the speaker and headphone sides. No complaints from anyone I\\u2019ve talked to on the headphones. Your music will start right back up once the call is ended. Totally hands free and couldn\\u2019t be any easier to use! Battery Life - As mentioned, they came fully charged and after multiple days of use, they are still at 60%...this absolutely crushes the battery performance of my other NC headphones. And on top of that, there\\u2019s a quick charge feature that adds 3 hours of charge in just 3 minutes. Worrying about battery life is completely off the table based on my experience to date. Pros: - Noise Canceling and Sound Quality are second to none - Support for connecting to 2 different devices simultaneously - Ease of adjustability of sound and functions - Touch & Automatic Controls - control your music, pause or call without ever touching your phone - Fit and comfort is outstanding, even after hours of use \\u2013 no hot spots - Sony\\u2019s Headphone Connect App give the user complete control over setup and functionality of headphones - Taking Phone Calls - crisp and clear even in a crowded room - Recycled packaging is a nod to the environment by Sony Cons: - The new case is a bit larger than in the past, not a huge issue, but something that stood out The Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are by far one of my new favorite devices and would 100% recommend them to anyone looking for the BEST noise canceling and function-packed over-the-ear headphones available.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"mstanleynh \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"These might just be as good as it gets..........\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 30, 2022\", \"content\": \"Ok, these are the first 'over the head' high quality wireless headphones I have used and I have to say they have set the bar really high. I have some top end wired Sony Hi Res headphones with no noise cancelling along with some competitors wired noise cancelling headphones and these beauties are on par if not better than both. Firstly the aesthetics are very good, you receive them in a Sony blended material box that might be completely recycled but has a nice solid feel to it and looks nice. Then, when you open up inside is the carry case which may be a bit thicker than I'd like but I'm happy to live with it as it keeps the contents safe. The first view of the WH-1000XM5 is impressive, nice matt finish with classy leather essentials that are very very comfortable indeed and I didn't find my ears getting too hot after 4 hours of continual wear. I'm not sure about all day comfortable but I don't think I could wear any headphones all day. The side panel with all the little tweaks and tricks is a joy to use after looking at the accompanying guide and very quickly becomes intuitive. This is very cleverly done and it seems they were developed with someone who has a similar brain to me because they just work. The sound is really really good with full range and depth, I don't know if I'm imagining it but feel it's not quite as expansive as when they are plugged in via the included cable, that being said Marvin Gaye singing Mercy Mercy Me in Hi Res on my Xperia 5ii is absolutely sublime with all the layers coming through nicely and Marvins smooth voice an utter joy. The noise cancelling is really effective and again the handy side panel enabling you to just hold it to hear is so handy. It makes you feel like it is just you and the music which is exactly what I want. I have used the 360 audio before with other Sony headphones and I have to say these seem to get a bit more out of the separation truly surrounding you with glorious sound. I subjected them to War Of The Worlds Multi Channel and it was absolutely stunning, I was completely lost for the duration, hanging on to Richard Burtons every word and emerged into the story completely. The bluetooth range is outrageously good compared to anything else I have, with the phone in the house I can reach the end of my garden (30m+) with ease and that's on 'Sound quality preferred' setting! All in all I'm struggling to find fault with these at all, maybe the price but realistically is there anything better out there? I'm not sure there is.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"occasionalstan \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Much improved sound quality and comfort\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 27, 2022\", \"content\": \"Sony have excelled once again improving from the previous WH-1000XM4 headphones which I didn't think was possible. These headphones are definitely more comfortable to wear for longer periods in part because the of the shape of the earcups, but more so because of the improved feel of the soft leather padding around the earcups. They also appear to provide much better soundproofing from exterior noise as they fit closer to the shape of your face, and that's without switching on Noise Cancelling which is excellent. Putting the headphones onto your head is now so much easier with the sliding headband, no more clicky settings, they just fit first time and I found the band very comfortable, possibly more so than the 1000XM4's. As for the touch controls on the right earcup, I think sensitivity may have been improved as sliding my finger up and down or across the cup face worked first time every time. Taking phone calls also worked very well, could hear my caller no problem and same for the person calling hearing me clearly. The voice pickup to temporarily pause music playing when talking to someone is nice to have as well and didn't let me down, can be activated/de-activated in the Sony app, your choice. As for sound quality, they are superb and is probably somewhat dependant on quality of the music files played. If you can play Flac/Lossless files using LDAC audio then you will love them as Sony have clearly done work on improving all aspects of the sound stage. I have played Classical, Pop, Rock and Electronic music files and in my opinion the instrument separation from bass through middle to treble was much clearer, especially in the top range. Bass wasn't overbearing, but you can make it so from your sound source and it might overtake the mid to high notes, but everyone has their own preference, just saying you can boom the bass if you want it. All in all I think Sony have a winner once again. If I was to find one thing I didn't like so much, it's the case. I know its a different setup to the folding 1000XM4's case which I really like, albeit you can't fold that down flatter like the one provided with the 1000XM5. A minor niggle that doesn't detract from a great pair of headphones.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Mel2955 \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 27, 2022\", \"content\": \"Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones The Sony WH-1000XM5 are so impressive featuring new drivers with flagship superb features and design, active Noise Cancelling (ANC) Fantastic for home, office, travel the list is endless. Optimised for Alexa and Google Assistant. The headphones are covered in a soft coating leatherette they are very comfortable to wear. One of the first things you notice when you open the box is the environmental packaging It's unbleached and wholly recyclable and uses no plastic whatsoever. The headphones are made mostly from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) which is useful material in acoustic terms which is mostly produced from recycled plastic and can be recycled again at the end of its life. So full marks to Sony for doing this. The Sony WH-1000XM5 main controls use capacitive touch panel on the right ear cup with actions as follows: Swipe Up = Volume Up Swipe Down = Volume Down Swipe Forward = Track forward Swipe Back = Track back Hold (Centre) =Voice assistant Double tap centre= Pause / resume Cup hand =. Ambient sound pass through On the left ear cup you will find two buttons, a power button and ANC mode button.Hold down the power button turns the headphones on after three seconds pairing will start, after that you can pair with your phone/computer. If you press NC/AMB button you can toggle the ANC mode, you are able to select the ANC/ANC off. The Ambient sound mode lets you hear what\\u2019s going on around you. You connect the headphones via Blue tooth or a TRS cable. When you listen to the WH-1000XM5 via the wired connection you turn the headphones on and that enables the ANC or leave them off. They sound quite different in passive mode. At the bottom right is a USB-C Charging port that allows you to charge the headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect App works great with these headphones and I highly recommend that you download it. Also you can get the latest updates for your headphones. Battery life for these Sony headphones is approx 30 hours on a full charge, if the battery is flat you can charge for just 3 minutes you will get 180 minutes of playback or of course you can always use the 3.5mm cable for analog playback. The headphones tend too boost the bass a bit too much with a detriment of the midrange however by using the App you can use the equalisation feature to tailor to your liking. These Sony Headphones support Sony\\u2019s high bit rate codec called LDAC which gives very good sound quality. On using the wired connection I found the sound performance identical to the wireless mode but you need to make sure they are powered on, if you listen in passive mode performance is not so good. The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones sport 8 microphones and the call quality is good and is excellent on zoom calls or phone meetings. It rejects outside noise well. Overall these Sony headphones are a great buy but expensive, but if you want the best they are definitely worth the outlay.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Cessnatim \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2I6iiJD-AhWRD1kFHaqADwsQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"So far, so good.\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 11, 2022\", \"content\": \"These are an early Christmas present for me, the first over-ear wireless headphones I\\u2019ve had, chosen because of the reviews testifying to very good sound quality, good noise cancellation, comfort and battery staying power. I\\u2019ve had them a couple of weeks and have used them most days, mainly in the evening but occasionally walking around doing things in the house - not used them outside. Mostly I\\u2019ve listened to music but I\\u2019ve heard a couple of podcasts too. The sound quality is lovely - the effects of tracks from Jean Michel Jarre where sound switches from one side to the other and back is reproduced brilliantly and the delicate background noises of trees rustling and goats on tracks recorded outside by Ballake Sissoko playing kora are fabulous. The human voice is a rich sound too, again with no apparent loss with even breathing audible on tracks where it was meant to be heard. Battery life seems very good. They arrived with about 60% charge and I recharged them when they got down to about 20% but that took about 10-14 days\\u2019 use of maybe 2 hours a day. No idea whether that\\u2019s good in comparison to others but certainly good enough for me. The set up was easy, noise cancellation is excellent from what I can make out, but I find the ability to pause this temporarily to head what someone is saying to me particularly helpful - just hold a hand over the right earpiece, ambient sound is restored very quickly and clearly, remove the hand and the music resumes. The headphones are comfy to wear, easy to adjust and while not tight, they seem to stay out so far when I\\u2019m bending down. The only very minor negative is that my ears get quite warm after I\\u2019ve worn them for about 1-2 hours, so I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019d want them on for really extended periods. But that would be the same or worse for all headphones so no difference for these and I suspect other models might not be as comfortable. It\\u2019s true there are no free lunches and you get what you pay for, but with these I feel I\\u2019ve got good value for money. They come in a protective case which also contains the charging cable, and the app might be useful for connoisseurs wanting to tweak the set up but I\\u2019ve just used them with my music app on the phone. So, I\\u2019d say so far, so good.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Jeff Foot \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}], \"description\": {\"product_title\": \"Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise-Canceling Wireless Over-Ear Headphones (Silver)\", \"product_description\": \"The WH-1000XM5 headphones rewrite the rules for distraction-free listening.

\"title\": \"Premium Sound\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"September 1, 2022\", \"content\": \"Bose has always been known to make audio products of the highest quality, And Bose\\u2019s newest earbuds the Quietcomfort Earbuds II do NOT disappoint. Packaging: Everything comes included in a small box, right away you can tell that the packaging was very well thought out and designed. Included in the box: Is a USB-A to USB-C cable, an upgrade to the older micro USB-B cable, so I liked that. Also inside the box you will find three different tips that are placed on the earbuds themselves, they come in small, medium and large, already installed are the medium sized ones, These fit the best for me. Also included are \\u201cbands\\u201d these bands wrap around the earbuds themselves. Basically what they do is they form a seal around your ear, These serve two purposes 1. they seal out outside noises out, and 2. They make the earbud fit perfect perfectly inside of your ear canal to protect against the ear buds falling out. Pairing: Connecting the earbuds to my smart phone was really easy, just press the button in the back of the charging case for a couple of seconds, pair them with your smart phone, and that\\u2019s it. Pretty standard and pretty easy. App: You\\u2019ll soon be prompted to download the Bose app. I Recommend everybody do this for couple of reasons, you can play around with the sound EQ settings, you can know exactly how much charge your earbuds have, you can program and swap different shortcuts, and the app can show you very well detailed tips on how to work your new earbuds, meaning it\\u2019ll show you how to pause your music, skip to the next song and raise or lower the volume by simply touching the side of the earbuds with your finger. Finally the thing I appreciate most about this app is that it doesn\\u2019t require you to create any kind of account if you don\\u2019t want to. Sound: The sound is as good as I have ever heard earbuds sound, clean, crisp, excellent highs, excellent mids, and the bass is good enough (these are not super bass heavy) there\\u2019s not much else to say really, these just sound great. Noice Cancelling: Perhaps the single greatest feature of these earbuds have is their sound canceling ability. When in \\u201cQuiet\\u201d mode, The earbuds block out sound better than any earbuds I have ever tried before, then there\\u2019s \\u201cAware\\u201d turn this on if you still want to listen to your music but still be able to hear outside noises (like if you are out in the street and still want to hear cars coming) I think what happens here is the microphone gets turned on and you\\u2019re then able to then hear the outside noises this way, kind of like a hearing aid. Both Quiet mode and Aware mode work very well. Conclusion: I recommend Bose\\u2019s newest earphones to anybody that is reading my review and interested in this product, you will be happy with your purchase. I highly recommend downloading the app and downloading the newest software update for them for the best experience. + Sound + Design + Features +App +The Bands +Comfortable +Battery life -Charging case is made of plastic and feels somewhat cheap\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Ernesto \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:15845363056501127493_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjczfWhiJD-AhWJFlkFHYCCCI4QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Outstanding BOSE sound quailty\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"September 6, 2022\", \"content\": \"We\\u2019ve used a few earbuds in the past, always different brands and were never totally satisfied with the sound quality, \\u201cespecially me with some hearing issues\\u201d. Bose has come out with a new model of the Quietcomfort earbuds, the \\u201cII\\u201d model was just released, and we decided to give them a try. Unboxing and setup: The earbuds come in a very small Bose logoed box, and inside there\\u2019s a charger case, \\u201cwith the earbuds nestled inside\\u201d, a USB C charging cable, sm/lg eartips, sm/lg stability bands \\u201cthe medium was already on the buds\\u201d, a quick start guide and a small but surprisingly thick manual in multiple languages. The first thing I did was to plug in the charging cable \\u201chave plenty of USB C ones already so didn\\u2019t bother with the OEM one, let them charge up and proceeded to start syncing. We also installed the Bose Music Android App before proceeding. Synching on our Samsung phones was simple, just open the lid to the charger, press the button on the back of the case/charger so the blue light blinks on the front then search/pair on your phone. Once we did that and the Bose app found them it immediately showed there was an update, so we let that proceed \\u201cwhich does take a few minutes so just be patient\\u201d. After the earbuds were paired it was time to try them out. Now these buds are a little larger than the Samsung ones we have \\u201cnot by much\\u201d and they do stick down a little more than them too, but once you find your fit they are just as comfortable \\u201cmaybe a little bit better IMO\\u201d, they didn\\u2019t feel like they were going to fall out easily and the app has a test you can run to be sure they are seated correctly. I do like to that they don\\u2019t actually turn on till one of them \\u201cright for us\\u201d is inserted and then you\\u2019ll hear the voice prompt confirming and battery charge. Use: We were both totally blown away by the sound quality, there\\u2019s even plenty of bass for us, and having any bass in a earbud is a pretty tough feat. Naturally it\\u2019s not chest pounding bass but it\\u2019s more than enough to give the feeling of nice deep bass, and that\\u2019s adjustable in the EQ of the App. We also like that you can adjust the noise cancellation can be adjusted from 0 \\u201cnone\\u201d to 100 \\u201cmax cancellation\\u201d, with it turned up to 100 I couldn\\u2019t make out what my wife was saying standing right in front of me, the same with her when she was wearing them, which was a little odd but easily adjusted so you can at least make out some background noise. These would be perfect in a very noisy environment as long as you don\\u2019t need to hear what\\u2019s going on around you. There are also multiple presets \\u201cmodes\\u201d that you can pick from and even customize your own. There\\u2019s also a setting in the noise cancellation that uses what BOSE calls \\u201cActive Sense\\u201d, it\\u2019s under the \\u201cAware\\u201d mode, and it will adjust the cancellation for loud noises so it will protect your hearing from very loud noises. It actually worked pretty well when I ran the vacuum cleaner, I could tell the sound was muffled but as soon as I turned it off I could hear the background noises again, \\u201cpretty neat\\u201d. I went outside and did some light yard work and only once did one of the buds come out a little, and that caused the sound to pause, so you know it\\u2019s not inserted correctly, an easy slight twist put it right back in. I contributed that to sweat running around my ears as it was 108F out and after a few minutes out in that anyone is going to be sweating. I\\u2019ve never had earbuds fit as well as these, most of the time I would just quit using them halfway through a project as they kept popping out due to sweat. As for call quality, neither of us had issues hearing calls, everyone said they heard us clearly and even with my hearing issues I could easily make out what everyone was saying. I will say I wish the equalizer could be adjusted for each earbud individually. My right ear is my troublemaker, and it would be nice to be able to adjust the equalizer separately so I could fine tune them. These actually sound much better than my Siemens hearing aids, and they don\\u2019t cost nearly as much. Listening to music is no compairson with them, and I usually use a full headphone to get full sound with the Bose I can get the same effect. The controls are easy to use, the outside of the main piece that sticks out \\u201csort of a oblong pill shape\\u201d , is the touch sensitive control. You can swipe up/down for volume, tap twice to advance track, three taps reverses and one tap pauses, pretty simple. You can answer calls with a single tap, and The only issue I had there is the touch area is very sensitive and it\\u2019s very easy to bump when you reach up to adjust the buds or try a function. Grabbing them gently by the sides and not bumping the touch sensitive area can be a little difficult at times but I\\u2019m sure it just takes some practice, but you have to be careful till you get used to them. Conclusion: We\\u2019ve never owned earbuds that actually sound as good as these, and the noise cancellation is simply amazing. I find myself wearing these most of the day as they are comfortable enough to forget you are wearing them, \\u201cI just have to remember not to have the noise cancellation up too high or I\\u2019ll never hear my wife calling for me, vice versa too\\u201d. If you are looking for a premium set of earbuds, and yes they do cost more than others but you are getting BOSE sound quality that goes with that. I won\\u2019t be using any of my other buds as they will just not stand up to these in any way that I can see, and for me, the sound quality is just unmatched.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"SteveC \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:15845363056501127493_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjczfWhiJD-AhWJFlkFHYCCCI4QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Very good, although not quite perfect\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 8, 2022\", \"content\": \"Having used a variety of over-ear headphones and earbuds of varying budgets (\\u00a3\\u00a3 to \\u00a3\\u00a3\\u00a3), wired and wireless, I wasn't quite sure what to expect with the Bose QC II Earbuds. Took me a while to get them fitting how I liked, especially as the fitment was different to the usual wired earbuds I've used for years, with the ear canal piece being more rectangular than circular. Eventually got them sitting right and the fitment does actually feel better than what I've been used to. Saying that, I often get this little nagging feeling that the left earpiece is going to come loose, and yet it's very much firmly in place if I try to move it about. Tried various combinations of the different sized accessories with no real improvement, but it's a minor quibble, especially as I've used these for home workouts successfully; they've certainly never come close to falling out or anything like that. Noise-cancelling is decent. A lot is made of how class-leading these are in that respect, and I certainly don't think they're anything less than very good in that department, but in terms of blocking out outside noise when there's no audio playing, I don't think they're a clear step-up over what I've been used to. Audio quality is good; definitely an improvement over my various pairs of earbuds I've had, although no better than a pair of popular wireless headphones I have, but then those have much larger drivers, so perhaps an unfair comparison. Only mentioning because I saw someone mention elsewhere that they replaced their OE headphones with a pair of earbuds, and I don't think I'd be doing that myself; these QC IIs are very much for situations where bigger headphones aren't really suitable, such as going outside or exercising/running etc. Bluetooth connection/App seems stable, not had any connectivity issues so far. Actually went into the garage and forgot to take my phone with me, but the signal was still fairly stable, even though I was quite some distance from the source and had several doors/buildings blocking the signal potentially, so I'd have no concerns about dropouts in normal usage, impressive in that regard. Touch controls are simple and effective, although the pause/resume function does \\\"feel\\\" a bit laggy, but that may well be to do with ensuring pausing/resuming gestures aren't mixed up with the next/previous track function. Not a big deal as audio stops promptly if you tap the earbuds, I just have to remind myself to give them a few seconds to resume when I tap them again. I do wish there was a little audio beep or something when adjusting the volume as there is with my headphones. Although speaking of volume, these do need to be at a higher volume level than what I'm used to with other headphones/earbuds that I wear. Overall, a good buy.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"SPZ02 \\u00b7 Review provided by bose.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:15845363056501127493_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjczfWhiJD-AhWJFlkFHYCCCI4QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Excellent Bass, Good Noise Cancelling for Ear Buds\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"December 21, 2022\", \"content\": \"I have always wanted to try Bose headphones knowing them to be a premium brand and having read many reviews. I have gone through a number of ear buds from a range of companies some premium and some more mainstream and always found the sound quality lacking in earbuds style as opposed to over ear designs. When I received my earbuds they were well packaged as you would expect the card case separates to reveal the various components of buds, case, cable and varying size buds and surround seals to ensure a good fit within the ear. As always frustratingly having opened the box everything needs charging so no fun for the first night! Within the pack is the QR code to download the Bose software for both IOA and android devices. Once charged and with software installed the setup was incredibly easy, it found the buds without having to go to settings find devices add pairing codes etc they just connected and then the software guided through the fitting phase to ensure the correct buds and surrounds were fitted. The sound test suggested everything was good to go. WOW was my first impression of sound quality, these little buds really had some good bass, within the app there is an equaliser which lets you change the base mid and treble and I am the sort of person that loves more Bass and Treble. these earbuds did not disappoint in sound quality for sure. Next came the programming of tap which in comparison to other models is more limited as there is basically a choice of which ear for the two settings, double taps, long taps etc are not catered for in this part of the app. The next test was for noise counselling which I have only ever found work fully on over the ear designs at premium prices. The noise cancellation in a normal environment is actually really good for these, it does not cancel everything but it certainly makes a difference and more so than other buds I have had in the past from premium brands. The only fault I have found is when cycling or running in wind conditions this is replicated as white noise slightly while listening to music. I think the only thing I have been disappointed with is the inability to charge the case wirelessly unless I have an incompatible charger this is not a feature of these earbuds as there was no evidence of charging no matter how I laid down the case and this is something I assumed would be the case. Overall these are the best earbuds I have owned so far, they compare with other brands but will still not beat over the ear!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"GEG87 \\u00b7 Review provided by bose.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:15845363056501127493_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjczfWhiJD-AhWJFlkFHYCCCI4QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Another flagship wireless earbuds from Bose\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"December 28, 2022\", \"content\": \"Designing appearances: First of all, the improvement of the charging box is particularly obvious. The charging box of Bose QC Earbuds II returns from the jewelry box style of the previous generation to the design direction of the mainstream TWS earphone charging box, resulting in a smaller size. What's more interesting is that the battery life of the charging box of Bose QC Earbuds II has been upgraded in spite of the reduced size! Wearing experience: The earplugs have undergone substantial alterations. Bose QC Earbuds II divided the previous generation of fish fin earplugs into two sections, the eartips and the stability bands, and called it \\\"Fit Kit ear kit\\\" The meaning of the Fit Kit is to solve the problem of ear fit for different users. You may encounter a certain type of noise-canceling earphones that are recognized as excellent in noise-canceling, but it feels average when it comes to you. The reason for this is probably that the earphones are not well adapted to your ear shape. After all, everyone's ear shape is different, and many people even have differences between their left and right ears. Noise-cancelling capability: Everyone who is familiar with the working principle of noise-cancelling headphones knows that the headphones will analyze and collect sound waves from the external environment, and create a reverse sound wave in the ear to cancel. The current flagship noise-cancelling headphones on the market perform very well in this regard. The Bose QC Earbuds II went a step further on this basis, focusing on the part of the ear, and made a smart in-ear sound field adjustment technology. When you insert the earbuds, you will hear a tone, which means that the smart in-ear sound field adjustment is working. At this time, it will automatically analyze the structure of the wearing ear canal, and then optimize the noise cancellation effect and sound quality of the earphones, thereby realizing \\\"volume customization\\\". Sound quality: The official description, the sound concept of Bose QC Earbuds II is balanced. After actual listening, I personally think it is true. The first impressions are incredibly supple and enduring. Each of the three frequency bands is fairly orderly, and nobody is trying to steal the show. Summarize: If you are looking for noise reduction and wearing comfort, Bose QC Earbuds II will not disappoint you!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"JC \\u00b7 Review provided by johnlewis.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:15845363056501127493_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjczfWhiJD-AhWJFlkFHYCCCI4QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"A music producers opinion\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"March 15, 2023\", \"content\": \"After ditching my old amazon bought earbuds and wearing over the had headphones for the better part of a year or so, I finally decided to get myself new earbuds. After about a month of research into what's on offer today I decided to use the 90-day risk free trial that is offered directly from Bose and go for the QC2, which are easily one of the most expensive earbuds you can buy, so do you get what you pay for? Yes. But here is my breakdown of all the features, from someone who has been producing and making music in studios for over a decade, I know a little thing or two about sound. So here goes. The Fit: Having the option between 3 different ear tip buds and 3 different wing bands leaves you with a good amount of choice in finding the fit that works for you, initially I found a good fit and the earbuds stay pretty firm in my ears for the most part. They have yet to actually fall out but I do find myself adjusting the left earbud quite frequently, as I get the feeling that it's going to fall out. This is quite annoying but manageable, and will be different for each user. I'm confident you'll find a good enough fit. The earbuds are comfortable for long periods of time and I have worn them for working out and they do stay put, but again, I find myself adjusting them a bit. Overall 4/5. The sound: I was expecting great things from the sound but overall, it is okay. It certainly isn't the best I've experienced, but certainly not the worst. The tuning is very well balanced I think, and there's no unusual emphasis on the Bass which is what a lot of companies tend to do so you get a fairly equal sound. I do sometimes find the high ends to be a bit harsh, particularly when listening to distorted guitar solos (Metallica, Megadeth etc) but this isn't too often. I do wish the sound would go louder though, My old earbuds would go very loud before hitting that phone sound warning that said you are in hearing loss territories but the QC2 don't go very loud before hitting that threshold, I find myself on the highest setting before the mark which is annoying because sometimes you want that loudness. This is probably my biggest gripe in terms of the sound, as a musician I appreciate the overall balance that these earbuds provide, but again, for the absolute best sound experience there are probably better earbuds out there. Overall 4/5 The noise cancelling and aware mode: Easily the best noise cancelling I've personally ever experienced. The quiet mode setting, truly gets rid of the outside world, it is remarkable. I can walk down the street with the setting enabled, with cars roaring passed me and I barely notice they are there, I'm focused on the sound on my ears which is an absolute blessing. The aware mode, which simulates Apples transparency mode is okay, I find there to be quite a bit of unnatural white noise which can become a bit tiresome after a while but overall it does a decent job. It also has an automatic feature which dampens loud sound around you (for example a door slamming) which is quite cool, but feels a bit weird. The noise cancelling though? Excellent. Overall 5/5 The app: I'm really not the biggest fan of the app. It's plain, boring, uninspired and you really don't get a lot from it. There's some tips and 'tricks' on there that really just tell you how to get the best fit for your ears etc. It let's you set two more custom noise settings (letting you adjust the level of noise cancelling and aware mode levels.) There's an EQ which lets you adjust the Bass, Mids, and Highs on the earbuds but you only get 3 bands which compared to other sound apps (JBL for instance) is quite terrible. If you want to adjust the sound I would recommend using a separate app with more customising options. Most of the time I find the earbuds cannot connect to the app anyway and without the connection, you are unable to do anything on the app, rendering it completely useless. Overall once you've had a look at the app, set your EQ preferences and set your noise modes, you won't be using it much and it's quite forgettable. Overall I'd give these earbuds a 4/5. With a good fit, good sound, great noise cancelling and and okay app these earbuds are certainly up there in terms of what you can buy. I do however think they are overpriced. I personally just do not think they are that good to be charging one of the highest prices on the market for earbuds, if you can get these discounted then certainly go for it but at full price, I do think there are probably pretty good cheaper alternatives. If you're main buying point is noise cancelling though, you probably want to take the plunge on these though. Do I regret buying them? No, they are good. But think carefully about how much you are willing to spend.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"DJN \\u00b7 Review provided by bose.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:15845363056501127493_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjczfWhiJD-AhWJFlkFHYCCCI4QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Best noise cancelling\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 9, 2022\", \"content\": \"These are the best noise cancelling earbuds, I have owned Jabra, Samsung, and Sony earbuds also. These have such good noise cancelling that my wife came behind me while I was doing dishes talking to my and said I could hear her and was just pretending I couldn't hear her, but I really couldn't hear her..... Now for the negative, my wife owns a dog training business and there are a lot of dogs that bark, it does a good job blocking out the barking except the very high pitches which you hear a popping sound, which I heard from interference with certain manufacturer machines that have a high pitch sound also. I do dislike how the left earbud is slave to the right earbud, which means you can't use the earbuds independently, with the right earbud being the master bud. But hopefully they will fix this with a futures update. But what I do LOVE and these earbuds is that I can pause, play, volume up/down, move track forward/backwards, and move between the different ANC seeing simultaneously with the right earbud. This is a phenomenal feature that I believe these are the only earbuds that have. They have definitely improved the Bass in this version and have superior sounds (Sony XM4's still have the best drivers but not much of a difference between these and Don't). Case size is normal for this price range, the obly 2 downsizes is no wireless charging (which I normally never use) and that the earbuds are not magnetic, sometimes they don't get a good connection to charge, but doesn't happen too often). People do complain about the eartip design, which does take a little to get use to, but after having it for a couple weeks, it does help with the ANC. As far as it's shape, I LOVE it. The XM4's, Samsung, and Jabras I would accidently be pressing the buttons taking the earbuds in and out, with these I can mess with them without worrying, which is a stress relieve. Battery life, they are not as good as Jabras, which have the best battery life I have tried yet, but after Jabra, they are are average for the price range. They ANC does drain the battery but as much as other brands, but worth it for how good the ANC is. Price range, the price is about right for what you are getting. Final words, they are the best wireless earbuds I have owned out of multiple brands for what I need. If you want best sound quality, go with the Sony XM4'S the 2022 version, not the /B version (which is having battery drain issues right now due to firmware update). If you want top of the line earbuds in budget I would go with either Jabra or Samsung, which both are GREAT earbuds. But the BOSE have THE BEST ANC, have all controls on the right earbud, great sound quality, and come from a good company. Do they have everything I want? NO, but I won't find an earbud that does. Do I sometimes question these earbuds, yes. Would I buy these again, in a heartbeat. So if you want an overall top of the line for earbuds, these are great! The only reason that I don't give them 5 stars is due to the periodically popping sound, which other earbuds have also (Sony, Dr. Dre) but should be able to be fixed in a software update, which when that happens I will give 5 stars and I am a rough at rating, my wife can tell you that.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"techsavy \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:15845363056501127493_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjczfWhiJD-AhWJFlkFHYCCCI4QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"Don't buy Bose at any cost!\", \"rating\": 1, \"date\": \"January 7, 2023\", \"content\": \"I originally bought the Quiet Comfort earbuds in January 2022 which needed replacing and repair about 4 times in a few months (which obviously took up A LOT of time with the admin of talking to JL and going into store etc), until the last time they got sent away where I was told there'd be a week turn around to receive another new pair. Fast forward 6 weeks and they're still 'in progress'. Had to speak to JL (and Bose) directly to find out they had no stock to send my replacement. I was about to give up and get a refund when I suggested I'd try the upgraded pair if JL would offer me that free of charge, which they kindly did (\\u00a330 difference). I received the QC II and had similar problems, left bud always draining of charge or not fully charging, the sound warping between both earbuds, the microphone picking up too much background noise so phone calls outside meant the recipient was not able to hear me, as well as trouble connecting to my phone on every start up, taking about 5-10 mins, putting them back in their case, restarting Bluetooth, opening and closing the app etc. Very inconvenient on the go. Alongside all these defects, the design was off for me. In order to scroll through various noise cancelling levels you can't just hold your finger on the earbud (which also, by the way, didn't fit in my ear properly so fell out multiple times, so-much-so I avoided wearing them when moving a lot), you have to press for ~2 seconds then release for ~2 seconds then press again etc to go through your various modes, which I felt was generally impractical and annoying, especially as it didn't respond to heavy touch but equally didn't with too light a touch. It also meant the right one was even more likely to fall out of my ear. It also made me look like a wannabe Spy. The noise cancelling also broke on the first few pairs I had, and a high pitched whining noise existed when not listening to music. To operate the volume control it requires a swipe, but it never seem to respond properly and would often pause my music or end the call I was on (which is actually the double tap function). All in all, it was a terrible purchase I wish I'd never made, but it was made slightly simpler by the fact the in-store John Lewis Tech team in Bristol made the return easy for me and were very helpful. I am now sworn off Bose for good (I also have a portable speaker which has connective and sound quality issues) but the silver lining is that I would purchase from JL again, knowing that my purchase was protected.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Kitty \\u00b7 Review provided by johnlewis.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:15845363056501127493_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjczfWhiJD-AhWJFlkFHYCCCI4QqSQIeQ\", \"title\": \"amazing sound quality. lacks some features\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"October 5, 2022\", \"content\": \"I rate these headphones a 4 out of 5 mainly because of the sound quality but I have a few things I'm disappointed in especially because of the price point. i really wish the bose name wasn't so large on the side of the earbud it's so distracting wish it was maybe smaller or on an edge. it has no wireless charging BUT that means it weighs less not an issue for me. there is no indication on the case that says anything about the battery and its a bigger case than other types of wireless earbuds but significantly smaller than past bose cases so that's good. there isnt a button that allows you to open the case which means that the case opens too easily also from my experience. the magnets don't really help the case stay closed. the process to pair it is a little difficult. first of all you have to have the app which i don't like and a lot of other wireless headphone don't need an app but if you want to customized your sound quality these are a great option.i like the ear buds that just pair with the phone by Bluetooth but this is definitely very technical The best part about these headphones is that they do live up to the Bose name in terms of noise canceling. It feels like it adjusts to the sound intensity. The quality of calling people is good also because it's very clear. I do agree that the charging time for the earbuds lasts about 6 hours with no issues. Again, you can customize the sound quality on the app. As most earbuds, these come with 3 different soft silicone ear tips and 3 stability bands but for the price I do think there need to be even more tip options for a good fit for everyone These look big in my ears but I was suprised they aren't heavy. I do wish that again for the price point that they would come with the option of over the ear holders too. It seems big but they do have a lot of features especially the swiping on the outside of the earbud wide portion that's unique and there's enough room for your finger to slide easily and a groove to know when to stop You do need to use certain functions on certain earbud and not that can be done on either one. The quiet and aware modes are unique and I'm glad there two options, you may need to play around to get used to them. I personally like the aware mode as it allows for more background noise to get in and I can still pay attention to other things, but there is an area you can change the noise cancelation and tailor it. I think you can only use the voice feature on the right earbud. you can't use one earbud independent of another at the moment uless you leave both outside the case but i did read it may become Available in an update. you also have to be careful with the amplifying power of these earbuds because some sounds are so loud in your ear. personally i do not walk around with earbuds i only use them to work out but would definitely not wear these all the time if I was looking for that option without removingsome of the noise canceling because its so intense almost like wearing earplugs. PLEASE add a find my earbud feature to the app it's really needed!

You know it's working as each bud plays a short note before announcing the device it's paired with, and that announcement goes from being a tad muffled to crystal-clear in the space of a second or less, as the NC is adjusted. Sound Quality The Bose buds have a beefy sound that's underpinned with solid bass, not muddy in any way. The top end can be shrill but is easily moderated with the in-app equalizer. The noise cancellation really helps by removing all distractions and allowing you to focus on the music, it might not be audiophile quality but it is very satisfying. Noise Cancelling Just amazing. I have a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 which were, until now, pretty much unbeatable. The Boses handily trump them. There is some hiss if you have them NC on with no music, in a quiet room, but in any other scenario they are a miracle made flesh, they simply erase what's going on around you better than any other headphone I've heard. The 'aware' mode is great too, people talk about the Apple Airpods Pro as having the best but these are in the same division, passed through noise sounds very natural and that mode doesn't make the music sound tinnier as some others I've heard do. Battery life Good, or rather, normal. 6 hours-ish plus 2 more charges from the case with NC on all the time. Fit and comfort Good, if unusual. There is a pack containing 3 sets of rings and 3 sets of ear tips, the rings help to hold the buds in place and form a seal, the tips do what tips normally do and you can get a perfect fit by mixing and matching them. The app has a sound test you can run to check if you have the best fit, which works perfectly. In my case the defaults were just fine.

Assuming you'll want 6 GHz capability for a bit of future proofing (maybe not?).  Wifi 6 routers (which do not have a 6 GHz band) are coming down in price as 6E (does have 6 GHz) becomes more the \\\"norm\\\".\\n\\nThen there are the aesthetics/cosmetics - most routers perform best if out in the open in a centralized location, but a lot of people consider traditional routers with lots of antennas, etc unsightly.  For those, systems like a single Nest or Eero router might be visually appealing, but then people have concerns about Amazon/Google and privacy, and both companies have struggled with their implemenations of wifi 6E, and both routers have some mediocre tech and consumer reviews.  I've used both BTW, and even a single unit from a mesh system is a \\\"router\\\" with probably decent specs and would get the job done.  Single nodes from Asus and TP-Link systems can also work perfectly well.  Just be careful, because some tri-band routers (all Orbis and many wifi 5 and 6 TP-Link Decos) have dedicated backhaul bands, so if using as as single unit, you're essentially buying an expensive dual-band router.  The 6E tri-band Decos and most Asus tri-band routers have settings where you can make all bands available for clients.\\n\\nFor 1,000 sq ft and what sounds like fairly modest needs, almost any single router would do the job well unless you have unusual building materials or obstacles.  Personally, I agree with the other poster that both Asus and TP-link make the best routers, when looking at a combination of price, reliability, stability, and performance, or overall value.  Asus routers are probably the most configurable consumer routers available.  Most mesh systems (other than Asus) are managed via an app and have relatively little configurability.\\n\\nI currently use an Asus ET12 system with two (wired backhaul) nodes - but they're rather expensive - and I will say it's the best-performing router I've ever used, and it's been totally stable with about 95 clients on my network, for several months now.  So it's my personal \\\"best\\\".  But you can buy an individual node, or if you don't care about antennas, an Asus AX86U is a great value (but no 6GHz), and it's still a bit above your price range at $250.  I say that as someone who's used various Eeros, Nest wifi, Linksys routers, Orbi (fast but super unstable for me), TP-ink Deco units (very good all around but I need dual WAN and Asus routers mostly support the ability to connect two ISP's simultaneously), and various other Asus routers.\\n\\nI'd stick with a consumer router for your needs.  Trying to convert a PC to a router and buying AP's seems overly complex and a hassle for what your needs are.  There are lots of single-router options for a couple of hundred bucks or less. The TP-Link AX73 or Asus RT-AX3000 are both well under $200 (both are wifi 6).  An Archer AXE75 (TP-Link) is tri-band and has 6 GHz, and is currently $197 on Amazon.  The Deco XE75 is about $175 for a single node and is also tri-band 6E, and a single Nest Pro 6E node is about $200 and also has 6 GHz.  A single eero 6E node is a bit over $200.\"]}, {\"title\": \"What router do you recommend? : r/homelab\", \"link\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/107jvol/what_router_do_you_recommend/\", \"comments\": [\"opnsense. running on a 100$ optiplex SFF  \\n\\n\\nI can pretty much guarantee it will outperform any consumer router you can find on a shelf.

routers aren't the sexiest product in the world to talk about but they are one of the most important devices in your house to help you get fast feeds and help your wireless devices connect to the internet before we dive into our recommendations here's some general things to consider when buying a router how big is your home how many devices are on your home network just a few laptops and a phone or a bunch of smart Tech like locks lights and gaming devices does your home get gig speeds Wi-Fi 6 is the standard in home router speeds able to handle crowded networks at top speeds but some routers offer Wi-Fi 6E a special designation for devices that can broadcast in the new six gigahertz band I know that's a lot to think about but don't worry I got you covered in this video I'm going to show you the best picks under 100 mesh routers for those of you who need more coverage and the best routers for those with blazing fast gigabit internet thank you all right let's start with the budget picks everything in this section is going to be 100 or less even at a hundred dollars you don't have to compromise and get an older model there are so many affordable routers that support Wi-Fi six that's the current generation of Wi-Fi available now for instance this one the tp-link Archer ax21 is a Wi-Fi 6 model that retails for 100 but you can often find it on sale for 70 or 80 you can tell it's a Wi-Fi 6 router by looking at the speed rating ax 1800 ax is the shorthand code for Wi-Fi six and eighteen hundred tells you the combined top speeds of each of its two bands in our test the Archer ax21 outperformed other ax 1800 routers on a 300 megabits per second fiber Network offering fast speeds and plenty of range for small to medium single story homes meanwhile the Netgear r6700ax is another 4 portable ax 1800 router that's on sale at Amazon for 89 dollars super similar to the Archer ax21 but the Netgear has noticeably faster upload and download speeds when we tested it on a gigabit fiber network with top speeds of about 940 megabits per second if you're paying for fast internet speeds like those at home but you still want a good router on a budget then Netgear r6700 pays for itself [Music] if you've had trouble getting consistent Wi-Fi from one end of your home to the other then we recommend going for a Wi-Fi mesh system a mesh system uses multiple routers placed strategically around your home these mesh routers create one big Wi-Fi mesh so your devices have a stronger signal across a wider area and there are a few routers at the top of our list first up is The Deco w7200 another Wi-Fi 6 option from tp-link it's available as a two-piece system for about 189 dollars at Walmart The Deco W 7200 is a tri-band mesh router which means it has an extra five gigahertz band the system can use for passing data back and forth without interference from any of your other devices that helps it offer fast reliable speeds and that's exactly what we saw when we tested it out plus the second extender device automatically pairs with your network as soon as you plug it in the other mesh system we'd recommend is the Euro 6 Plus which you can find on Amazon in a two pack for 240 or in a three pack for three hundred dollars full support for Wi-Fi 6 and newly added support for extra wide 160 megahertz channels make it a powerful system that can handle lots of data at fast speeds if you're living in a smart home with lots of connected lights locks and other gadgets the built-in radios for zigbee and thread make it an outstanding pick if you've upgraded to gigabit speeds at home recently congratulations that's about five times faster than the average internet connection in the US so if you're looking for a high speed gigabit ready router to match here's what we'd recommend your first upgrade option is the Asus RT ax86u one of the company's top Wi-Fi six gaming routers it comes with an app that can help control latency which can be handy if you're a gamer over the last few years of CNET test it's consistently shown to be one of the fastest and most capable routers we've tested you can get it with a port that supports internet plans as high as 2.5 gigabits per second for about 280 dollars that's a good deal but the Asus model is missing one thing support for Wi-Fi 6E which offers access to the newly opened six gigahertz band the extra wide band has tons of room for band with heavy internet traffic and the only devices that can use it are other Wi-Fi 6E devices so so you'll need a Wi-Fi 6E phone or laptop in order to get any use out of it but it also means that you won't need to worry about older devices interfering with your connection still more and more devices are offering 6E capability so grabbing a Wi-Fi 6E router is still a sensible pick for your home network especially if you're living with gigabit or better speeds so Wi-Fi 6E a good option is this mesh router the Euro Pro 6E stands out for its exceptional all-around performance and a noticeable speed boost to Wi-Fi 6E devices you get the same radios for zigbian thread as the Euro 6 plus plus a tri-band design it's an expensive option at 320 dollars for a two pack or 450 dollars for a three pack but in our test it was able to match high-end mesh systems that cost over one thousand dollars we also like the Linksys Hydro Pro 6E for its Simplicity consistent speeds and strong performance do you own one of these let us know how it worked out for you in the comments below check out all of our router recommendations at cnet.com happy router hunting thank you [Music]

Not everybody needs the kind of performance that you get with the latest and greatest models, and there's no reason to pay for features that you will likely never use. If you're looking for a lower price rather than a big bundle of bleeding-edge features, check out this list of budget routers. But if you have several family members vying for bandwidth for things like streaming Netflix video and playing PC games online, a new router with modern management capabilities can make a world of difference and help keep the peace. Below we guide you through choosing a router that will handle your current and future wireless networking needs, and offer our top picks to get you started. What Do the Different Wi-Fi Bands Mean? Nowadays, any router worth its salt will offer at least two radio bands, a 2.4GHz band and a 5GHz band. The 2.4GHz band operates at a lower frequency than the 5GHz band and offers better range because it is more adept at penetrating walls and other structures. However, it doesn't offer the fat pipe and high-speed access that you get with the 5GHz band. Additionally, the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi band has to compete with other devices in the home that use the same frequency, such as microwave ovens, Bluetooth gear, and wireless phones. That said, it is perfectly adequate for tasks like web surfing and connecting to social media services like Facebook and Twitter. If one or more of your devices will be streaming video from a service such as Netflix, or connecting to an online gaming service, the less crowded 5GHz band offers significantly more throughput with minimal signal interference. Most dual-band routers allow you to assign a band to specific applications and clients, thereby easing the load on both bands. If you have a busy network with numerous clients vying for bandwidth, a tri-band router is the way to go. They use three radios\\u2014one that operates at 2.4GHz and two that operate at 5GHz, for load balancing. For example, you can dedicate one of the 5GHz bands to handle tasks like video streaming and torrent downloading, and reserve the other 5GHz band for online gaming, leaving the 2.4GHz band free for applications that don't require lots of bandwidth. If you have a house full of gamers, we have a specific best gaming routers list for you. Finally, there's the new 6GHz spectrum, recently made available(Opens in a new window) by the FCC. While this new spectrum promises a significant boost to overall wireless network performance, few devices support it yet, so take performance claims with a grain of salt. For more on that topic, see our story on What Is Wi-Fi 6E? Which Wireless Protocols Should I Look For? Wireless Ethernet networks use 802.11 protocols to send and receive data. The most widely used Wi-Fi protocol, 802.11ac, allows for maximum (theoretical) data rates of up to 5,400Mbps and operates on both the 2.4GHz and the 5GHz bands. It utilizes Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology, which uses several antennas to send and receive up to eight spatial streams, resulting in enhanced performance. It also supports beamforming, a technology that sends Wi-Fi signals directly to a client rather than broadcasting in all directions, and automatic band-steering, which lets the router select the most efficient radio band based on network traffic, band availability, and range. The 802.11ac protocol also offers downstream Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) technology, which is designed to provide bandwidth to multiple devices simultaneously rather than sequentially. That means up to four clients can have their own data streams instead of waiting in turn to receive data from the router. In order for MU-MIMO to work, the router and the client devices must contain MU-MIMO Wi-Fi circuitry. Routers that support MU-MIMO are widely available, but the fact that consumers have been slow to understand exactly what the benefits of MU-MIMO are has kept the number of client devices somewhat scarce. You'll see 802.11ac routers with labels like AC1200, AC1750, AC3200, and so on. This designates the theoretical maximum speed of the router. For example, a router that can achieve a maximum link rate of 450Mbps on the 2.4GHz band and 1,300Mbps on the 5GHz band is considered an AC1750 router. A tri-band AC3200 router gives you 600Mbps over the 2.4GHz band and 1,300Mbps over each of the two 5GHz bands, and an AC5400 router is capable of speeds of up to 1Gbps on the 2.4GHz band and 2.1Gbps on each of the two 5GHz bands. It's important to note that routers rarely, if ever, reach these \\\"maximum speeds\\\" in real-world applications, but if you're looking for performance, consider one of the high-speed routers (but be prepared to pay a premium). We thoroughly test all routers that come through PC Labs, so you'll know how much muscle a product has before you buy. 802.11ax, the technology behind today's leading-edge Wi-Fi 6 routers, is now hitting the market with frequency. Wi-Fi 6 is an evolution of 802.11ac technology that promises increased throughput speeds (up to 9.6Gbps), less network congestion, greater client capacity, and better range performance courtesy of several new and improved wireless technologies, among them Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and Target Wake Time (TWT). OFDMA improves overall throughput by breaking Wi-Fi channels into sub-channels, allowing up to 30 users to share a channel at the same time. Target Wake Time (TWT) is designed to reduce power consumption by allowing devices to determine when and how often they will wake up to begin sending and receiving data. TWT tech is expected to extend the battery life of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, as well as battery-powered smart home devices such as security cameras and video doorbells. Additionally, 802.11ax takes advantage of previously unused radio frequencies to provide faster 2.4GHz performance, and it uses refined uplink and downlink bandwidth management to provide enhanced Quality of Service (QoS). It also offers uplink and downlink MU-MIMO streaming (whereas 802.11ac only supports downlink MU-MIMO). As with the 802.11ac protocol, 802.11ax is backward-compatible and will work with devices that use 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi radios. For more on the benefits of the 802.11ax protocol, check out our primer What Is Wi-Fi 6? and see our speed tests. And as mentioned earlier, Wi-Fi 6E, with support for the 6GHz band, is the latest standard, but 6E routers are just starting to hit the market and we've tested just a handful at this writing. Which Other Wi-Fi Router Features to Look For? Wireless routers come with a variety of features, and as is the case with just about everything, the more features you get, the more you can expect to pay. Look for a router with at least four 10/100/1,000 (gigabit) Ethernet ports, which allow you to connect to wired devices such as desktop PCs, network-attached storage (NAS) drives, and home-automation hubs. If you require faster throughput for large file transfers, look for a router that supports link aggregation. Simply put, link aggregation uses two gigabit Ethernet LAN ports to provide increased throughput (up to 2Gbps). It also provides a fail-safe if one LAN connection goes down and can be utilized to load-balance your network traffic. Having at least one USB port on the router makes it easy to plug in a printer or a USB drive and share it across the network, but with two ports you can do both. Additionally, try to choose a router that offers removable antennas. Some router manufacturers offer replacement high-gain antennas that will help boost performance, and there are a number of third-party antennas available. Just make sure your router supports whatever antennas you buy, or you'll probably wind up with decreased performance. If you want to manage how your Wi-Fi network is being used, make sure your next router has parental controls, QoS options, and a guest-network feature. Parental controls allow you to limit network access for certain users to specific times and days, ideal for parents who want to keep tabs on their child's online gaming and social networking activities. Some routers offer basic parental controls such as access scheduling and website blocking options, while others provide more robust controls that give you the ability to pause the internet and select age-appropriate presets that will automatically block access to social media platforms and sites that contain things like adult content, gambling, shopping, blogs, and games. A guest network lets you offer Wi-Fi connectivity to guests without leaving your entire network vulnerable. In a nutshell, you're creating a separate network for guests with a Service Set Identifier (SSID) and password that are different from your main network credentials. This lets your guests connect to the internet, but it doesn't give them access to your files, printers, and other connected devices. With QoS settings, you can decide which applications and clients get network priority. For example, if one device is streaming Netflix video, and another device is downloading files or running a print job, you can give priority to the streaming device to avoid choppy, out-of-sync video. The same goes for online gaming; assigning a high QoS priority to a gaming console such as the Microsoft Xbox Series X or the Sony PlayStation 5 will help reduce lag time and improve overall gameplay. It also means you can keep those new work applications protected, like a phone using voice over IP (VoIP) or that webcam that's keeping you connected to your office staff meeting via video conferencing. Almost all routers offer several forms of security. A router with Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) lets you add compatible devices with the push of a button. Just press the WPS button on the router, then press the WPS button on the client device to add it to your network. For a more secure connection, you can use Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA or WPA2), which requires entering a network password for each device. Routers with WPA-Enterprise security offer a higher level of security than WPA/WPA2, but they require a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server to authenticate each client. The technology currently used to assign IP addresses, known as Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), will eventually be replaced by its successor, IPv6. IPv4 is a 32-bit addressing scheme that before long will run out of addresses due to the number of devices connecting to the internet. IPv6 is a 128-bit scheme that will offer an (almost) infinite number of IP addresses. Most current routers have built-in support for IPv6 addressing, but it's a good idea to verify this if you want to be ready for the transition when IPv4 finally hits the wall. Does the Price of Your Wireless Router Matter? Like anything else, router pricing is based on performance and features, which means you can see some big cost differences depending on the kind of router you're considering. The numbers and letters in the router's name are often a hint of the features it offers and thus how much it costs. An entry-level AC1750 802.11ac router will cost anywhere from $60 to $100, for instance. But if you want an AC2400 router with MU-MIMO streaming capabilities, expect the price to land in the $100 to $200 range. A tri-band AX5400 gaming router with all the bells and whistles could cost as much as $500, while the newest 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6E routers can range above $500, depending on throughput rates and features. As you'll see below, Wi-Fi mesh systems can be even more expensive. Remember that those prices typically reflect you buying not just a single router, but one or two mesh nodes, too. How Can I Extend My Wi-Fi Signal? If you live in a large or multiple-story home, you may have Wi-Fi \\\"dead zones.\\\" These are areas of your home where your main router isn't able to reach with a wireless signal. An easy way to solve this, without the hassle of running long cords around your home, is a Wi-Fi range extender, which will pick up your router's Wi-Fi signal, amplify it, and rebroadcast it. They come in both desktop and plug-in variations, and are relatively easy to install. They do have limitations, though: The rebroadcasted signal is typically half the strength of what you get from your main router, and most of these create a separate network that makes seamless roaming through your home difficult. However, some router manufacturers are now making extenders that will share the same network SSID and password as your existing router. There's a catch, however: The router usually has to be made by the same manufacturer as the extender and must support seamless roaming capabilities. Should I Consider a Wi-Fi Mesh Network System? If a range extender doesn't do the trick, consider overhauling your network with a Wi-Fi mesh system. This technology offers an easy way to fill wireless dead zones in your home without the need for additional wiring, range extenders, or access points. They utilize extension nodes, or satellites, to extend your Wi-Fi signal across a larger area than most routers are capable of. Systems such as Google Wifi and the Linksys Velop employ mesh technology, where the satellites communicate with each other to provide coverage throughout your home, while others use a dedicated Wi-Fi band to communicate with its satellite. Depending on the number of nodes in the system you choose, you can spread a consistent internet connection across as much as 4,000 to 6,000 square feet of space. Satellites in a Wi-Fi mesh system are all part of the same network and provide seamless connectivity as you roam throughout the house, and they do not usually require any configuration or management beyond a few taps on a free, associated mobile app. A number of the solutions in this category support high-end features like guest networking, device prioritization, parental controls, and MU-MIMO, but because Wi-Fi mesh systems are designed to be simple, in most cases you won't be able to access the same kind of in-depth settings you can on routers. For that reason, power users and compulsive tinkerers might not love Wi-Fi mesh systems, but for everyone else who finds network setup intimidating, these are among the friendliest and most innovative options you can find today.

We've tested the top Wi-Fi router brands so you can find the right one for your needs. How to shop for a Wi-Fi router in 2023 How we test Wi-Fi routers You don't have to spend a fortune to get good, reliable Wi-Fi. In fact, one of the best routers we'd recommend is the TP-Link Archer AX21, a well-tested Wi-Fi 6 model tha's available for as little as $70. But that may not be the right router for you. The best fit for your home network depends on multiple factors. Everything from the size and layout of your home to the content you stream plays a role in deciding what router you'll need. Fortunately, we've tested dozens of the latest models to help find plenty of good picks for a variety of homes and users. It's a particularly good time to make sure that your router is up to snuff. Even as things have opened up again since the early days of the pandemic (and the surge in home internet use that came with it), reliable Wi-Fi at home remains a necessity. The good news is that routers have come a long way in the past few years, with a number of today's best Wi-Fi router options boasting impressive speeds and features worth investing in. Shopping for a faster internet speed? For starters, there's a new and improved version of the Wi-Fi standard called 802.11ax -- or Wi-Fi 6 -- and it boasts faster, more efficient home network performance. On top of that, there's a growing number of mesh router options that are well worth considering, too, particularly since many of them are far less expensive than the router combo systems that came before them. Locating local internet providers Shop around, and you'll also find new Wi-Fi 6E routers capable of sending signals using newly opened bandwidth in the 6GHz band. Just don't expect routers like those to come cheap. All of that means that you've got a lot to think about if you're currently in the market for an upgrade. That's where we come in. Whether you're interested in gaming routers, mesh systems, Wi-Fi 6 routers or if you just want something decent that won't break the bank, we're here to simplify things and point you in the right direction so that you can find the best Wi-Fi router to manage your needs. Expect regular updates to this post as we continue testing networking devices periodically. When we find a new router that merits strong consideration, we'll add it to this list with links to our most recent test data so that you can always find the best router. Read more: Best Internet Providers for 2023 Best Wi-Fi routers of 2023 Available for $100 (or less if you catch a sale), the TP-Link Archer AX21 is an entry-level, dual-band Wi-Fi 6 router that supports top speeds of up to 1,201Mbps (1.2Gbps) on its 5GHz band. It's nothing fancy, but it offered near flawless performance for small- to medium-size homes in our tests, and it's a cinch to setup and use thanks to TP-Link's Tether app. Best of all, when tested against other, similar routers from names like Asus and Netgear, the AX21 held its own with faster download speeds, better range, and low latency, too. Add in a functional bandsteering mode that automatically steers you between the 2.4 and 5GHz bands within a single network, plus guest network controls and even a quality of service engine for prioritizing traffic to the most important devices on your network, and you're looking at a decent home networking upgrade that's as simple and affordable as it gets. It isn't powerful enough to max out speeds on a gigabit network, but it can still hit consistent close-range speeds near 700Mbps or so, which is more than enough for most households. Read our TP-Link Archer AX21 review. Linksys Hydra Pro 6 (MR5500) If you've already got a budget router running your network and you're ready to upgrade to something more powerful, the Linksys Hydra Pro 6 belongs high on your list. With a dual-band, AX5400 build, full support for Wi-Fi 6, and 160MHz channel support for moving data more efficiently, it was an excellent performer in my speed tests, even managing to outperform flashier picks like the also great Asus RT-AX86U. The Hydra Pro 6 is a touch pricey as dual-band routers go, but the steady, consistent performance makes it a standout. Try and catch it on sale if you can, but if you just want a reliable, no-frills router that can keep up with gigabit speeds, look no further. Read our Linksys Hydra Pro 6 review. Best mesh router overall For the best performance from your mesh router, you'll want to prioritize getting one with support for Wi-Fi 6, plus a tri-band design that includes three separate bands of traffic: the usual 2.4 and 5GHz bands, plus an additional 5GHz band that the system can use as a dedicated wireless backhaul for transmissions between the router and its satellites. Most mesh routers like that cost at least $300 or even $400, but the TP-Link Deco W7200 gets you there for less than $250. That's the best deal I've seen for a tri-band mesh router with support for Wi-Fi 6 -- and sure enough, it's an excellent performer, as well. In fact, the only system that managed to outperform it outright in my at-home speed tests is the AX6000 version of Netgear Orbi, which costs more than three times as much (keep reading for more on that one). On top of that, TP-Link's setup process is about as easy as it gets, with satellite extenders that automatically join the mesh as soon as you plug them in. Read our TP-Link Deco W7200 review. Gaming routers promise high performance and low latency for die-hard gamers, and it isn't uncommon to find them selling for $300 or even $400. At about $270 or less, the Asus RT-AX86U dual-band router isn't inexpensive either, but it's a strong value relative to routers like those -- and the performance it delivers as a gaming router is flat-out great. Most noteworthy is the router's latency management. In fact, it leads all of the routers I've ever tested, gaming or otherwise, with the lowest average latency across all of my tests, which online gamers will definitely appreciate. Something else you'll appreciate: An excellent mix of app-based controls and features, including a mobile boost mode, that lets you prioritize gaming traffic to your phone at the touch of a button. Gaming features aside, the RT-AX86U offers full support for Wi-Fi 6, with strong, stable speeds and good range. If you need additional range, you can add other Asus \\\"AIMesh\\\" devices to your home network to make it the centerpiece of a mesh. That checks off all of the boxes that most people want from a good gaming router, and it gets you there at a price that isn't too painful for us to recommend. Even if you aren't a gamer, this is still one of the best Wi-Fi 6 routers you can buy right now. Read our list of the best gaming routers. Netgear Orbi (dual-band, AC1200) Best mesh router on a budget It isn't as fully featured as systems that cost more, and it doesn't support Wi-Fi 6 -- but aside from that, the budget-friendly, AC1200 version of the Netgear Orbi mesh router stands out as a clear value pick in the mesh category. Currently priced well below $100 for a three-device setup with the Wi-Fi router and two satellite extenders, it's an affordable system that managed to keep up with both Nest Wifi and the Wi-Fi 5 version of Amazon's Eero mesh router in our speed tests, and it'd be a great fit in homes with internet speeds of 300Mbps or less. In fact, of those three systems, Netgear Orbi clocked in with the fastest average top speed at close range -- and it displayed surprisingly strong signal strength when we mapped those signals out at the CNET Smart Home. I even like the design, with clever contours on top that vent out heat in style. If you're curious about mesh routers but put off by the high asking price, then give this bargain system a shot. Read our Netgear Orbi review. Netgear Orbi (tri-band, AX6000) Best mesh performance Starting at $700 for the two-piece setup seen here, the AX6000 version of the Netgear Orbi is far more expensive than the dual-band version listed above, but it's also a lot more powerful. With a second 5GHz band serving as a dedicated backhaul for system transmissions between the router and its satellites and full support for Wi-Fi 6, the system is still our top-tested mesh router, with the best scores in both our lab-based top speed tests and our at-home mesh coverage tests. In the latter round of tests at my home, on a 300Mbps fiber internet connection, the Orbi AX600 returned average speeds of 289Mbps to Wi-Fi 5 devices and 367Mbps to Wi-Fi 6 devices, including speeds at the farthest point from the router that were 95% as fast as when connecting up close. That's a near perfect result, and one that no other mesh system I've tested has been able to match. Is that sort of speedy performance worth $700? I think most will find better value with something less expensive -- and you've got a growing number of solid options that fit the bill. Still, if you're buying right now and you want elite mesh performance, price be damned, then this is the system to get. Read our Netgear Orbi 6 review. How to shop for a Wi-Fi router in 2023 At this point, Wi-Fi 6 is well-entrenched as the de facto standard for the latest Wi-Fi gadgets, so it's worth getting a Wi-Fi 6 router if you're looking for something new. Wi-Fi 5 routers will continue to get the job done, and there are a few that stand out as worthwhile budget picks, but you'll want Wi-Fi 6 for the latest features and fastest speeds. For smaller homes and apartments with internet speeds of 500Mbps and less, an entry-level Wi-Fi 6 router like the TP-Link Archer AX21 will do a fine job handling your everyday network traffic. If you live in a home with faster, gigabit level speeds, or if you have multiple power users on your network, then it's worth stepping up to a more powerful midrange model like the Linksys Hydra Pro 6 or the Asus RT-AX86U. The Eero Pro 6E mesh router is one of a growing number of routers that support Wi-Fi 6E. Devices like those can send signals in the 6GHz band, which offers lots of bandwidth and very little interference. If you live in a larger home or one with multiple stories, then stepping up to a mesh router that can offer better reliability at range makes a lot of sense. You can find a full slate of top picks in my mesh router rundown, but the TP-Link Deco W7200 stands out as an affordable option that tested well. Meanwhile, the Eero Pro 6E is my top mesh pick for homes with a gigabit connection. That Eero Pro 6E system is one of a growing number of routers that support Wi-Fi 6E, which adds in access to the ultrawide 6GHz band. The only devices that can connect over that band are other Wi-Fi 6E devices, which means that it's largely free from interference. Wi-Fi 6E is more than most homes probably need, but it's worth considering if you're looking for something future-oriented, as the number of home Wi-Fi devices that can connect over 6GHz is expected to grow. That said, at this point, the smarter play for future-focused shoppers might be to hold out until 2024, when we expect to see the full ratification of Wi-Fi 7, the next big generational update for Wi-Fi. Some manufacturers like TP-Link are jumping the gun with Wi-Fi 7 router releases in 2023, but buying in now seems premature given that the standard isn't fully ratified yet and there isn't a Wi-Fi 7 device certification process yet. How we test Wi-Fi routers Like a lot of people, I spent the majority of 2020 and 2021 working from home, and that included my router tests. Last year, in 2022, I relocated my home test setup back to our product testing facility in Louisville, Kentucky. My operating procedure is largely unchanged -- I start by setting each router up in a fixed location in our lab, and once it's up and running, I run a multitude of speed tests from five different rooms nearby. I start in the same room as the router, I run multiple speed tests on a Lenovo ThinkPad laptop with full support for Wi-Fi 6, I log the results in a spreadsheet, then I move to the next room and repeat. Once I've run tests in all five rooms, I repeat the entire process, but this time, I start with a fresh connection in the room farthest from the router. Your distance from the router when you first connect will make a difference in how the router handles your connection, so running a split of front-to-back and back-to-front tests helps to keep my averages rooted in real-world results. I run the entire process detailed above (a front-to-back round of speed tests, followed by a back-to-front round) three separate times: once during morning hours, again in the early afternoon, and once again during evening hours. I also run a separate round of tests to a Wi-Fi 6E device (a Samsung Galaxy S21 smartphone). If the router allows me to separate each band into a separate connection, then I'll run separate rounds of tests for each band to see how they perform when isolated. After all of that, I'm left with a comprehensive look at how the router's speeds hold up to different devices across different distances, as well as how the router handles other considerations, like latency. From there, I make sure to evaluate each router's features and its ease of use, as well as considerations like security standards, smart home compatibility, and overall value relative to the competition. I'll post the answer to commonly asked router questions below -- if you have any others, feel free to reach out on Twitter (@rycrist), or by clicking the little envelope icon on my CNET profile page. Doing so will let you send a message straight to my inbox. What does a Wi-Fi router do? You need to be connected to your modem in order to send and receive data from the web -- your router lets you do that without need for a wire. It's basically a big, fancy antenna for your modem that lets you connect with it wirelessly, over Wi-Fi. You can also use that local Wi-Fi network to connect with other devices at home, like printers or remote storage servers. How much should I spend on a router? It depends on what you need and how many people and devices need to connect, but a small- to medium-sized home or apartment can probably get by with a well-tested dual-band router in the $100 range. If your home is larger, then it's probably worth spending more on a mesh system that can spread more consistent speeds from room to room. And if you're working from home, gaming online or sharing bandwidth with multiple housemates or family members, upgrading to something like a high-speed tri-band router is probably a good investment, too. How do I set up a Wi-Fi router? The old-fashioned way is to plug the thing in and connect it with your modem via Ethernet cable, then type its IP address into a browser's URL bar to begin the setup. The easier, more modern way is to use the router's app, which will typically walk you through setup in about 5-10 minutes. After setup, you can also use either approach to access the router's settings or change your Wi-Fi password. What do the different Wi-Fi bands mean? You can think of your router like a radio -- it sends and receives signals through airwaves. Whereas a radio picks up audio broadcasts in AM or FM airwaves, a Wi-Fi router sends and receives data through 2.4 and 5GHz airwaves (as well as 6GHz airwaves if it's a fancy Wi-Fi 6E router). Nearly all routers include separate radios for those bands, which lets you connect to whichever band is best. Some routers will automatically steer your connection between the multiple bands available, but you can usually turn that off as well, making each band its own, separate Wi-Fi network. The 2.4GHz band offers better range than higher bands, but speeds are limited. With 5GHz (or 6GHz), you'll be able to hit much faster speeds, but those speeds will drop off at range faster than you'll see with 2.4GHz. In general, the 5GHz band is going to be your best bet for a reliable, high-speed connection at close and medium range, while the 2.4GHz band is great for devices at the far reaches of your Wi-Fi network, where the improved range is worth the speed tradeoff. How do I know when it's time to update my router? In most cases, you won't need to worry about updating your router more than once every five years or so, if not longer. That said, there are few things to watch for that might give you good reason to consider something new. First, you should know that the Wi-Fi standard gets a generational update once every several years. The latest of which, Wi-Fi 6, ushered in faster top speeds and better efficiency for crowded networks with lots of devices. The next big update, Wi-Fi 7, is expected to arrive in 2024, and it stands to offer even faster top speeds and better use of the 6GHz band once it becomes a fully ratified standard. You shouldn't feel compelled to upgrade to a new generation as soon as it arrives, but it's definitely something to keep an eye on if you're looking for top-tier Wi-Fi performance. More important is to make sure that your router is still receiving regular firmware updates against the latest security threats. If it isn't, then it might make sense to go ahead and upgrade. I'd also look for something new if my router didn't support WPA3, the most recent Wi-Fi security protocol. If you're thinking of upgrading because your home's internet speeds aren't satisfying, try testing those speeds out across different distances (and remember that you can only connect as fast as your ISP plan allows). If speeds seem fine when you're close to the router, but they plummet when you're a few rooms away, then upgrading to a router with stronger radios, or a mesh router with multiple devices, could be a worthwhile investment. Should I consider a mesh router? Mesh routers use multiple devices to relay a better Wi-Fi signal throughout your home, with fewer dead zones. It's definitely the right approach if you live in a large, multi-story home, or if there are multiple spots in your home where you can't connect as reliably as you'd like. There are lots of great mesh systems up for sale at this point, and prices have come down significantly in the last few years. For more information and our top recommendations, be sure to check out our full rundown of the best mesh Wi-Fi systems of the year.

With high-end performance and lifetime protection against intrusions and malware, it's also a great option for securing your entire home network, providing long term protection without a subscription fee, and carrying a two-year warranty. But the real draw of the Asus RT-AX86U is the performance, which in our testing approached the the magical 1Gbps mark to provide speedy and effortless connectivity for all of our devices. With excellent range and great performance \\u2014 even through walls and between floors \\u2014 the RT-AX86U is equal parts general-use router and elite gaming router, and the collection of features and ports it offers are a steal compared to some of the top-performing gaming gear. If you want the best Wi-Fi 6 router for the whole household, the Asus RT-AX86U is it. Read our full Asus RT-AX86U review. 2. Netgear Orbi WiFi 6E (RBKE963) Netgear's Orbi WiFi 6E (model number RBKE963) is one of the best mesh Wi-Fi systems on the planet \\u2014 and also one the most expensive. But if you have money to burn, a gigabit broadband connection from your ISP and an enormous house, then this is probably the mesh system for you. The Orbi WiFi 6E can cover up to 9,000 square feet. Add a third satellite and you can go to 12,000 square feet. At a distance of 15 feet, the router's 6-GHz channel delivered throughput of more than a gigabit per second, the first mesh router to do so in our tests. Each unit has 12 antennas and four Ethernet ports (one rated at 2.5 Gbps), and the system creates channels on the 2.5, 5 and 6-Ghz bands, plus a fourth 5-Ghz one for backhaul between units. Netgear offers trial subscriptions to its Armor security software, which includes Bitdefender antivirus, and parental controls. You'll also have to pay for tech support after 90 days. But if you can afford to pay for this mesh system, you won't mind. Read our full Netgear Orbi WiFi 6E (RBKE963) review. 3. TP-Link Archer AX6000 Wi-Fi 6 routers are usually more expensive, but value is the name of the game for the TP-Link Archer AX6000 router, our favorite budget-friendly Wi-Fi 6 router. It may lag on performance and range but it offers Wi-Fi 6 speeds for less than competing Wi-Fi 6 models. Think of the Archer AX6000 as the affordable router for the first generation of Wi-Fi 6 devices. With eight wired networking ports and the ability to pair two together to create a 2Gbps stream of data, TP-Link\\u2019s Archer AX6000 router leads the way for Wi-Fi 6 routers that are just as good with wired devices as they are at Wi-Fi. By adding in router-based security, the Archer AX6000 stands alone as one of the best routers you can get, at a price that's hard to beat. Read our full TP-Link Archer AX6000 review. 4. Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (RAX80) With the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (RAX80) Wi-Fi 6 router, top performance and enhanced security go hand in hand, combining throughput that smashes through the gigabit per second barrier with malware protection and the Disney Circle app for blocking inappropriate content and managing family network use. With excellent performance through walls and floors, the Nighthawk AX8 will work just as well in the real world as in the lab. It may be expensive \\u2014 most Wi-Fi 6 routers are \\u2014 but the RAX80 was easy for us to set up and lets you configure the router exactly the way you want it. It's also got a 90-foot range, but we found it delivered better performance at distances of 50 feet, making it better suited to medium-sized homes. By almost any measure, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (RAX80) is the Wi-Fi-6 router to get if you don\\u2019t want to compromise on speed and safety. Read our full Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (RAX80) review. 5. Asus ROG Rapture GT-AX11000 The first gaming router we tested withs Wi-Fi 6, the Asus ROG Rapture GT-AX11000 is a gamer's delight, with speed that improves over longer range, low latency and all the features that gamers expect. Add it all up and most other gaming routers are now second best. The GT-AX11000 is large, with a gargantuan base, eight swiveling antennas, and massive 10.8Gbps maximum throughput. This wireless router has connectivity in droves, thanks to its tri-band design and four downstream Gigabit LAN ports, a single 2.5G Base T Ethernet connection, and two USB 3.0 ports. Built-in customization and gaming-oriented optimizations provide plenty of control, and you can even pair it with other Asus routers for mesh networking to cover a larger home. At $450, it is expensive, but this is one of the best gaming routers for those that want an edge online. Read our full Asus ROG Rapture GT-AX11000 review. The Google Nest Wi-Fi combines an excellent mesh Wi-Fi router with a smart home speaker, giving you whole-home connectivity along with the benefits of Google Assistant, wherever you are in your house. Although they lack WI-Fi 6, they have both Bluetooth and 802.15.4 Thread mesh networking built in to efficiently connect with low-power home-automation devices. However, if you want a mesh router from Google with Wi-Fi 6E support, the Nest Wifi Pro is now available but it isn't compatible with Google's other routers and lacks smart speaker functionality. While the overall throughput of the Nest Wi-Fi isn't the best among mesh routers \\u2014 it had a peak throughput of 653.2 Mbps in our tests \\u2014 we liked that each satellite was small and unobtrusive, so it wouldn't look out of place on a bookshelf. All in all, this is a great little mesh Wi-Fi system at a reasonable price especially now that it's successor has been released. Read our full Nest WiFi review. 7. Netgear Nighthawk RAXE500 The Netgear Nighthawk RAXE500 was the first Wi-Fi 6e router to hit the market, and the results are mind-blowing. By adding the new 6-GHz band to the already impressive capabilities of Wi-Fi 6, the Nighthawk RAXE500 delivers category-leading performance \\u2014 but at $599, it's not cheap. This tri-band device more than lives up to the hype by delivering nearly 2.5Gbps of real-world data in our testing. Add this to the slick design and highly customizable configuration options, and the Netgear Nighthawk RAXE500 becomes one of the best wireless routers we've ever reviewed. While it\\u2019s best at close quarters and is one of the most expensive routers you can buy, the RAXE500 is worth every penny if you have the need for speed. Read our full Netgear Nighthawk RAXE500 review. The Reyee RG-E5 is a real bargain for a Wi-Fi 6 router that can cover 3,000 square feet. It can also become the center of a mesh network when paired with other Reyee gear and there's even a one-touch button to simplify the setup process. However, the Reyee RG-E5's budget price means this router lacks things like extra security software, port aggregation and a USB port for connecting storage devices to your network. At its rear the Reyee RG-E5 has four gigabit Ethernet ports while the eight flipper antennas at the top of the device can be adjusted for a better signal. In our testing, the router was able to deliver 849.2 Mbps at 15 feet though it has a range of 100 feet. If you want to upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 without breaking the bank, this is the router to get. Read our full Reyee RG-E5 review. 9. TP-Link Archer C5400X The TP-Link Archer C5400X is the gaming router to beat, with some of the best performance you'll see in any single home networking device. It offers best-in-class tri-band performance, delivering 1Gbps over its 2.4GHz band and 2.167Gbps over each of its two 5GHz channels. It also has impressive coverage, with more than 100-feet of superb coverage that will blanket most homes in strong, clear Wi-Fi signal. The spider-like 8-antenna design and red-on-black color scheme are sure to turn heads, but the real selling point is the collection of optimization and security features that will satisfy any power user. With excellent bandwidth-allocation controls to let you use the massive throughput as you wish, this router puts incredible performance into the user's hands, for gaming or anything else. Read our full TP-Link Archer C5400X review. 10. Linksys EA8300 Max Stream For a truly customizable router, we recommend the Linksys EA8300 Max-Stream, which is not only a great tri-band router, it's also loaded with tools to tweak and customize your router for optimal performance. The small black EA8300 Max-Stream can move lots of data, though it will do best in smaller homes. But even with shorter range, it offers impressive performance for a router that sells for less than $200. Whether you're allocating bandwidth to prioritize gaming or media streaming, or just setting up parental controls, you can automate many features, make manual adjustments on the fly, and monitor it \\u2014 all from your desktop or smartphone. With so many ways to customize your router\\u2019s performance, the Linksys EA8300 Max Stream is an easy pick for the power user. Read our full Linksys EA8300 Max Stream review. Is it time to update your Wi-Fi router? Maybe you\\u2019ve noticed that your current Wi-Fi coverage feels slower than it used to, have been experiencing spotty reception, or maybe you just need something better equipped to handle the demands of the growing number of smart home devices at your house. If you\\u2019ve been dealing with any of these issues, a new router should be able to fix these common problems. It\\u2019s also worth upgrading to a new Wi-Fi router if you\\u2019re still using older hardware. If you have an old Wireless-N or Wireless-AC (retroactively renamed Wi-Fi 4 and Wi-Fi 5 respectively) router in your home, you should definitely consider upgrading to something more current. Newer standards will not only provide faster connectivity but there are other benefits as well. For instance, your smartphone battery will last longer as a result of more efficient device management and your connected home gadgets will all feel much faster with these more capable standards. The other big reason to upgrade your router is that you\\u2019re tired of paying a monthly rental fee for a router from your ISP. Since average equipment rental fees cost anywhere from $10-15 each mount, a new router can pay for itself in just a short amount of time while providing you with better service and features. Just don\\u2019t forget to pair it with one of the best cable modems if you want to entirely free yourself from the extra costs that often come with broadband internet packages. How to choose the best Wi-Fi router for you When it comes to choosing the best wireless router for your home or small business, it\\u2019s easy to get lost in the complex networking jargon and obscure technology standards. However, all you really need to know is how to answer two key questions: What speed do you need for your internet connection? And what sort of coverage do you need? Speeds and standards: The internet speed you need for your router is determined by the speed you get from your internet service provider as well as the speeds supported by your modem. For most people, a standard 802.11ac router will handle all but the highest performing plans, like Gigabit internet plans that aren\\u2019t available everywhere just yet. With average broadband speeds at around 100 Mbps, most wireless AC routers will be able to handle the job with ease. The latest technology for routers is called Wi-Fi 6 (aka 802.11ax) which is a faster standard that\\u2019s better suited for households with a lot of smart home devices. There are many Wi-Fi 6 routers available today, though there\\u2019s an even newer twist on this standard called Wi-Fi 6e that takes advantage of a newly opened part of the radio spectrum. Wi-Fi 6e-enabled devices, such as laptops and smartphones, are still few and far between. Unless you\\u2019re using a dozen devices at once, you likely won\\u2019t see much benefit from upgrading to Wi-Fi 6e at this time. See our article What is Wi-Fi 6E: Routers, devices and how it's better than Wi-Fi 6 to learn more. Coverage range: The other part of the wireless equation is coverage area. A basic standalone router will generally offer 50 to 100 feet of range, so that it can easily cover the majority of apartments and smaller homes. If you have a house with 3,000 square feet or more of space, you\\u2019ll want to consider a mesh router instead which use multiple devices to provide a strong Wi-Fi signal throughout larger homes. These are especially helpful in multistory houses or in homes with dead spots where the Wi-Fi signal drops out. Ports: Though wireless connectivity is the main thing you want from a Wi-Fi router, you\\u2019ll also want to think about wired connections. Ethernet offers faster connectivity for devices like game consoles and smart TVs that use more bandwidth and USB ports are handy for connecting older printers or storage to your network. Input is another issue, especially if you live in an area where Gigabit internet is available. With a Gigabit connection, an older router can be a bottleneck, slowing down your entire home. Some routers can even aggregate two inputs for even faster connectivity. Price range: Current 802.11 ac routers often sell for less than $100 for basic, dual-band models. More expensive modems range up to $300 but offer better coverage and faster speeds, while gaming routers have built-in optimization features and typically sell for more. New routers using the Wi-Fi 6 standard (previously known as 802.11 ax) often cost $400 or more.

How we test Wi-Fi routers We test every router we review to measure performance and range, in addition to hands-on use to evaluate the ease-of-setup and quality of settings and features. Throughput describes how much data the router can move back and forth over its wireless connection. Higher throughput will serve you better in data-heavy uses, like streaming video, gaming, or connecting multiple users at once. We measure throughput using IXChariot (opens in new tab), first at a 5-foot distance without obstructions, so that we can gauge the maximum amount of data that the router can move. We then measure how much data the router can move at 50, 75 and 100 feet, so that you can also choose the best model for smaller homes and apartments, where short-range performance may be the priority. We also test performance through walls and ceilings, to determine how well a router can provide signal in the Wi-Fi-dampening conditions common to many buildings and homes. For mesh routers, we perform additional testing to determine how well the mesh system does sending a signal through both the main router and through a satellite unit. Following out throughput tests, we also put the router through real-world tests by connecting a number of devices \\u2014 laptops, TVs, smartphones, and tablets \\u2014 and stream a number of games, TV shows and movies simultaneously to see how well the router performs under strain.

We will be renting three guest rooms that will all need access to good wifi and a separate password. I need very fast (preferably wired) and reliable internet for work that doesn't slow down when guests use the internet. I would really appreciate a recommendation with approx. pricing. However, a good system is a higher priority to price.Reply avtellaThe Qualcomm CPU/WiFi chipset based Netgear R7800 has the best 5Ghz range/performance of any consumer router I have tested (am a beta tester) and a pretty good 2.4Ghz performance as well. Better than any on that list to be honest. If you want in depth reviews look at small netbuilder and CNET has some simpler reviews too but the R7800 in pretty much most sites, tops other routers in 5GHz performance and range. VPN performance is also better than the Linksys units as it has more powerful/newer gen CPU. Also its the only one with a properly working MU-MIMO implementation. The R7800 actually is more powerful CPU and WiFi chipset wise than the R8500, only advantage the R8500 has is the extra 5Ghz band which I don't think will help you that much and will definitely not increase range by any means. The Synology RT2600AC also uses the same hardware as the R7800 and is also a good alternative.Broadcom based routers from Netgear/Linksys (Marvell based units as well)/Asus can cause performance degradation with MU enabled, as Broadcom's implementation sucks. The Asus 86U is also close to the R7800 WiFi wise but its Broadcom based, though using an improved WIFi chip compared to older Broadcom units. FYI compared to the 88U (similar to R8500) the 86U is actually more powerful and using newer gen hardware, only reason the 88U is higher priced is due to extra lan ports.Reply frawenzThank you avtella, really appreciate it!!!Reply robo21I would avoid Netgear like the plague, I have had the worst support experiences with them. 90 days tech support, lousy warranty and their technical support staff lies trying to sell extended support packages. They actually told me that I needed to upgrade my Internet Service File for $99.95. What a crock!Reply r.s.lynnI want to buy a new wifi router that has the functionality to allow geographically distant family to download selected photos and videos from a USB-attached external hard drive. It would be convenient for me to know which wifi routers have US-based tech support. ASUS does not have, at least not at level 1, native English speakers, and the ones I spoke with had poor English skills.Reply dnrcohenI have a backhouse that is about 75 feet away from the main house. We will be connecting a desktop (in the backhouse) , a laptop and a phone line (although none will probably be used at the same time. Which router would you recommend. Thanks!!Reply ljctx49ATT is installing the BGW 210-700 Modem/Router as their latest unit. Questions:1 - ATT sells the AirTies 4920 as a match to establish a whole house mesh network. Any experience?2 - What is the average range of the BGW?3 - Why should I buy another router and bridge the BGW for $XXX AND added complexity?Reply captjacknyHow about a review of the Edimax routers? Model 6208 V2 is under $50 and has a lot of features such as 802.11ac.Reply pat.mccarthy07604How about the Norton router. Norton touts it as the greatest thing since sliced bread.

If your router is more than a couple of years old and is struggling to give you fast speeds, or dropping connections altogether more often than not, a new router or a mesh-networking kit will improve your Wi-Fi\\u2019s range, stability, and speed all over your home. Up-to-date techOur top picks support the Wi-Fi 6 standard, which helps handle busy networks with a wide variety of connected devices. Wi-Fi 6E and 7 are too early in their life cycle to recommend for most people. Our top picks support the Wi-Fi 6 standard, which helps handle busy networks with a wide variety of connected devices.

A well-placed router should connect you to the internet anywhere in an apartment or a small house. No lag or very little lagA great router minimizes the wait even if the network is busy serving other devices. A great router minimizes the wait even if the network is busy serving other devices. Over the past four years, we\\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours testing and evaluating more than 100 routers, and we\\u2019ve determined that the best router for wirelessly connecting your laptops, your smart devices, and anything else your daily life depends on is the TP-Link Archer AX55. The best Wi-Fi router The TP-Link Archer AX55 created a speedy, responsive network throughout our test house. You have to spend a lot more on a router\\u2014or a mesh kit if you have a very large home\\u2014to get anything even a little better. It\\u2019s our latest Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) router pick. *At the time of publishing, the price was $98. Hitting the sweet spot between price and performance, the $100 to $125 TP-Link Archer AX55 broadcasted a reliable and responsive Wi-Fi 6 network in our test home. You can find routers that offer faster speeds, and ones that are cheaper, but the Archer AX55 is the one in the middle we\\u2019d suggest for most people right now. It provides strong Wi-Fi service throughout a 2,000-square-foot, or larger, home. Future-proofed, high speed, high price If you have gigabit internet service or want to dig into the settings to fine-tune your network, the RT-AX88U\\u2019s extra features and improved speed and range are worth the higher cost. But it\\u2019s overkill in most homes. The Asus RT-AX88U had close to the least lag of any router we tested, and it was faster overall than our top pick, but you pay twice for what is basically a small improvement for most people. We think the upgrade is worth the expense if you\\u2019ve already invested in gigabit internet service and need a powerful router to work with all that bandwidth. This model is also great if you want to spend an hour or five over the weekend tweaking your router settings to optimize a new smart device or your videoconferencing performance, because it provides more options for customization than our other picks. For smaller spaces or fewer devices The TP-Link Archer A8 is relatively inexpensive and still performs better at close range than pricier models. It\\u2019s a reliable option for a small home or an apartment with a few people and their devices. If you\\u2019re looking to save money, or if you have modest needs, the TP-Link Archer A8 can still provide a solid network for a small home or a multiroom apartment. At longer distances, it\\u2019s measurably slower than our more expensive picks, so it\\u2019s not well suited for multistory houses, and the connection may stutter if it isn\\u2019t centrally located in an apartment or home with more than two bedrooms. But over shorter distances in our tests, the Archer A8 was still able to outperform some routers that cost over $150. The Archer A8 also has modern features like WPA3 and compatibility with TP-Link\\u2019s OneMesh extenders, eclipsing our last budget pick, the Archer A7, in that regard. Everything we recommend The best Wi-Fi router The TP-Link Archer AX55 created a speedy, responsive network throughout our test house. You have to spend a lot more on a router\\u2014or a mesh kit if you have a very large home\\u2014to get anything even a little better.

Why you should trust us Our pick: TP-Link Archer AX55 Upgrade pick: Asus RT-AX88U Budget pick: TP-Link Archer A8 Other good Wi-Fi routers How we tested, plus the results Router setup and network maintenance What to look forward to What is a Wi-Fi router? And other frequently asked questions What to look forward to Why you should trust us Before joining Wirecutter, Joel Santo Domingo tested and wrote about PCs, networking, and personal tech at PCMag.com, PC Magazine, Lifewire, and HotHardware for more than 17 years. Prior to writing for a living, Joel was an IT tech and system administrator for small, medium-size, and large companies. Metaphorically, Joel has been a wire cutter for more than two decades: Testing wireless home networking has been a part of his life for the past 20-plus years through all versions of Wi-Fi, back to the wireless phone extension he tacked onto the back of his Apple PowerBook. He did that so he could connect to the internet from his desk, his couch, and his bed seamlessly (a rarity for the time). If you\\u2019re happy with your Wi-Fi, you don\\u2019t need a new router\\u2014it\\u2019s as simple as that. If you\\u2019re having problems with range, speed, or reliability, though, and your router is more than a couple of years old, it might be time for an upgrade. An older router that doesn\\u2019t support Wi-Fi 5 (also known as 802.11ac) or Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) and drops connections constantly, needs frequent reboots, or is slow even when you\\u2019re in the next room can hold you back significantly. This guide covers standalone Wi-Fi routers. Our top picks will easily outperform most routers more than a few years old and are likely to save you money if you\\u2019re currently renting a basic router from your internet service provider. These routers are a good fit for apartments or small to medium-size houses with three or four people on the network. If you have more people or a large house\\u2014more than 2,300 square feet, or more than one floor\\u2014you should probably look at our mesh-networking guide instead. A good rule of thumb is that if you\\u2019ve considered adding a wireless extender or an extra access point to an otherwise satisfactory router, get a mesh system instead. If you\\u2019re happy with your Wi-Fi, you don\\u2019t need a new router\\u2014it\\u2019s as simple as that. What you shouldn\\u2019t do is blindly buy either the cheapest router or the most expensive router you can find. Quality doesn\\u2019t necessarily scale with price, and a router with a bigger number on it or a plethora of antennas may not actually solve your Wi-Fi problems. We researched dual- and tri-band routers from each of the major router manufacturers, including Asus, D-Link, Linksys, Netgear, and TP-Link. We also looked for routers from less well-known manufacturers with strong reviews from tech experts or potentially interesting features that set them apart. We drew our eight criteria below from research, as well as extensive testing. Instead of testing for the maximum throughput from a single laptop, we positioned four laptops around a 2,300-square-foot, two-story suburban home to simulate the real-world activity of a busy home network. We tested for speedy throughput (streaming simulated 4K video and file downloads), long range (downloading a huge file), and short latency (simulating two simultaneous browsing sessions). We repeated each test set six times and averaged the results to smooth out spikes. See the How we tested section below for more details on our testing method and results. Current-generation technology: Since we\\u2019re looking to improve your Wi-Fi, we considered only dual- or tri-band routers that support the more recent Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6 standards. The cheapest routers\\u2014which cost as little as $20 or $30\\u2014use a single band, or frequency, of the Wi-Fi standard that came out in 2009 (802.11n, rarely referred to as Wi-Fi 4). Any phone or laptop you buy today or may have bought in the past few years uses the new standards, and having more than one band makes it easier for your router to manage traffic around any slower, Wi-Fi 4 devices on your network. Good speed test results: Speed claims on the box don\\u2019t mean much in the real world. In our tests, network speed, or throughput, varies from \\u201cThis YouTube video will never finish loading\\u201d to \\u201cYou can download a video game in an instant.\\u201d Generally, we looked for the routers that performed above average, and we dismissed the slower routers. Good range test results: You should be able to connect to a well-placed router from anywhere in an apartment or a small house. We tested each router from up close and from far away to confirm whether it will allow you, for example, to stream high-quality videos on the far side of your living space. Low latency test results: Slow internet sucks, and latency\\u2014or lag\\u2014is the time you have to spend waiting for the next thing to happen. A great router minimizes that wait even if the network is busy serving other devices. At least four Ethernet ports: A free Ethernet port gives devices such as TVs, streaming boxes, and gaming consoles the benefit of unfettered access to the internet bandwidth you\\u2019re paying for. We looked for routers with at least four ports, an arrangement that also lets you connect to any Ethernet or powerline extenders you have in your home. A fast processor and RAM: A router with a speedy multicore processor and extra RAM can handle more connected devices and offer improved performance. No matter how good the radios that broadcast the Wi-Fi are, the slow, single-core processors found in most cheap routers can still drag things down. Not all manufacturers publish these details, but we do consider the standout hardware when deciding what to test. Nice-to-have extras: Fast, reliable Wi-Fi is what matters the most, but more expensive routers add features that bring other benefits, too. The things we like to see that justify spending more for a router include link aggregation, built-in security utilities, extra Ethernet and USB ports, VPN connections, and parental filtering. Price: You can buy a router for $20, and you can buy one for $500. But we don\\u2019t consider the cheapest or the fastest to be the best. When considering both features and our test results, we looked for \\u201cthe best for the most for the least.\\u201d Right now, paying around $125 buys you excellent performance and features that offer real benefits. Spending twice as much buys small improvements for few people, and spending only half as much would mean, for most people, giving up a lot. In addition, we consulted customer reviews on Amazon and Newegg, plus professional router reviews and performance rankings from CNET, Dong Knows Tech, PCMag, PCWorld, SmallNetBuilder, and Trusted Reviews, to generate our list of contenders. After identifying every model that met all of our criteria, we thoroughly tested the most promising routers ourselves. Our pick: TP-Link Archer AX55 The best Wi-Fi router The TP-Link Archer AX55 created a speedy, responsive network throughout our test house. You have to spend a lot more on a router\\u2014or a mesh kit if you have a very large home\\u2014to get anything even a little better. It\\u2019s our latest Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) router pick. *At the time of publishing, the price was $98. The TP-Link Archer AX55, the successor to our former top pick, the AX50, is a Wi-Fi 6 router that hits the sweet spot of price and performance. For $100 to $125, it performs well enough and remains responsive when several devices are connected to and using the Wi-Fi network at the same time. The AX55\\u2019s improvements over its predecessor include WPA3 security and OneMesh expandability. It also had better throughput speed at a distance than the AX50, when the Wi-Fi signal had to penetrate through several walls. The Wi-Fi 6 standard (also known as 802.11ax) included in routers like the AX55 has proven itself a reliable technology over the past few years and will make a noticeable difference in how most home networks perform. If you own an older Wi-Fi 4 or 5 router, the biggest improvement you\\u2019ll notice with Wi-Fi 6 is how routers handle simultaneous connections to multiple devices\\u2014an increasingly common cause of wireless problems in busy households. Older routers simply switched back and forth between devices, albeit at an imperceptible rate; one \\u201cslow\\u201d device on an older router, and the whole thing would grind to a halt. But technologies such as OFDMA and MU-MIMO\\u2014which we discuss in a separate section below\\u2014make it possible for the AX55 and similar routers to keep more speedy connections active even with slower devices in the mix. At long range, when the signal had to pass through several walls, the AX55 performed better than most of the competition, aside from a few of our upgrade alternatives. The Archer AX90, for example, is a top-of-the-line router that costs two to three times what our pick costs, and even that model delivered speeds that were only 50% faster than what we saw from the AX55. Also at long range, the benefits of better Wi-Fi radios were clear: While the AX55 averaged 140 Mbps, our budget pick, the Archer A8, was relatively slow at 42 Mbps. Raw speed in the form of throughput, in megabits per second (Mbps), isn\\u2019t the only thing that matters, and our latency test showed how routers handled the added stress of multiple devices accessing the network at the same time. Many networks are prone to lag and delays while you wait for sites to even start loading. Judging by the Archer AX55\\u2019s results in our latency test, we can say it won\\u2019t keep you waiting, even when multiple members of your family are using the Wi-Fi at the same time. In this test the Archer AX55 saw lag times similar to the Synology RT6600ax and TP-Link Archer AX75, even though the AX55 is considerably cheaper than both of those routers. Like most of the routers we tested, the AX55 has five Ethernet ports: a WAN internet port for connecting your cable modem or fiber terminal, as well as four network ports for wired devices. That\\u2019s enough to keep your most demanding gear\\u2014streaming set-top boxes, TVs, and game consoles\\u2014hardwired if you keep your router near your entertainment center. If you find a NAS too intimidating or expensive but you want to take advantage of network-based storage anyway, the AX55 also has a USB 3.0 port for connecting a shared portable hard drive or SSD. This setup can\\u2019t replace a full-featured NAS, but it could help you back up your laptops regularly in the background. In contrast, less expensive routers are limited to much slower data transfers over USB 2.0 (the Archer AX21, for example) or lack USB connectivity entirely (the D-Link DIR-X1560, for instance). One reason a router like the AX55 performs better than other routers making similar claims relates to its processor and memory. Just as in a laptop, the processor and memory in a router affect its overall performance. A dual-core processor and 512 MB of RAM power the AX55, and we found that those components were sufficient for it to keep four laptops and devices chugging along successfully in our performance tests. In contrast, the budget-oriented TP-Link Archer A8 makes do with a single-core processor and 64 MB of RAM. More cores aren\\u2019t a guarantee of success, however: The Archer AX20, for example, has a quad-core processor, yet it performs similarly to the AX55. All routers walk you through initial setup, but TP-Link\\u2019s administration page for the AX55 resides in the Goldilocks zone\\u2014it\\u2019s neither too simple nor too complicated. Compared with TP-Link\\u2019s router setup, D-Link\\u2019s setup tends to be on the limited side, while Asus\\u2019s and Synology\\u2019s screens have multiple settings that appeal to tinkerers and similar geeks. Overall setup with TP-Link, either through TP-Link\\u2019s Tether smartphone app or the administration website, is quick. Note that you\\u2019ll have to sign up for a TP-Link cloud account if you want to use Tether. Parental controls, security, and performance are relatively easy to configure in the Tether smartphone app. Among the parental controls are basics such as time limits, content filtering, and bedtime settings. But don\\u2019t think these features are a replacement for talking with your kids and setting boundaries for screen time and being safe on the internet: Toddlers and preschoolers are relatively complacent, but no one has more time, drive, or incentive to circumvent parental controls than a bored teenager. If you want to prioritize functions like streaming over gaming or vice versa, QoS (quality of service) settings are also included and easy to adjust. The Archer AX55 can be expanded with TP-Link\\u2019s OneMesh Wi-Fi extenders, including our pick, the TP-Link RE315. However, we usually recommend that you upgrade to a mesh networking system if you have more than one or two dead spots in your home. TP-Link routers come with a two-year warranty, which is on a par with the coverage period for our other picks. The D-Link, Linksys, Netgear, and Ubiquiti routers have one-year warranties. Flaws but not dealbreakers The AX55 isn\\u2019t exactly aesthetically pleasing. It has four non-removable antennas connected to the back panel, and they are articulated and adjustable. However, the design of the Archer AX55 and its TP-Link siblings is noticeable, and not necessarily in a good way. The router\\u2019s body is vented for cooling, making it look like the router is striped, and the asymmetrical steps molded into the body will clash visually with nearly any decor. The Archer AX55 requires an online login for setup using the TP-Link Tether app, which can be partially circumvented by using the built-in website to set up the router. Some folks are actively looking for routers that don\\u2019t have any online logins, because they\\u2019re worried about companies mining their data and tracking them. However, more router companies are requiring online accounts for convenience, remote monitoring, and for paid subscription services. If you\\u2019re concerned about such things, we suggest moving up to the upgrade router pick, which can be set up and administered without an online account. Still, a lot of the functionality and some of the AX55\\u2019s settings are found only on the app, so if you want to have parental controls or monitor IOT security, for example, you\\u2019ll need a TP-Link Cloud Service online account. Using a burner email account is fine if you don\\u2019t want it tracking your primary email. You can check the AX55\\u2019s settings via both an internal website and TP-Link\\u2019s Tether smartphone app. Both offer basic settings for configuring the network, but the AX55\\u2019s advanced settings pale in comparison with those of the Asus RT-AX86U and the Asus RT-AX88U. We suggest considering either of the latter two models if you\\u2019re a networking whiz and you want to tweak your router\\u2019s radio strength, its channel selections, and the threshold where the band steering switches clients from 5 GHz to 2.4 GHz. If that last sentence sounds like incoherent technobabble to you, the AX55 would be more than sufficient for your needs. Another potential drawback is the $7 a month or $55 per year TP-Link HomeShield Pro subscription you\\u2019ll need for parental control software, network protection, and IoT security. Some basic functionality in the router is retained if you don\\u2019t pay, but advanced settings, most protection, and reporting are disabled after the one-month free trial. Upgrade pick: Asus RT-AX88U Future-proofed, high speed, high price If you have gigabit internet service or want to dig into the settings to fine-tune your network, the RT-AX88U\\u2019s extra features and improved speed and range are worth the higher cost. But it\\u2019s overkill in most homes. If you\\u2019re spending the extra dough for a gigabit (or faster) internet service plan, the Asus RT-AX88U is the router you should get to make the most of the bandwidth you\\u2019re paying for. It can broadcast a strong, responsive Wi-Fi 6 signal to all corners of an average home, and it has more ports for wired devices such as a desktop PC, a streaming set-top box, a gaming console, and NAS devices. In our tests, it outperformed other routers in speed and latency, and it includes upgrades that will keep it relevant in a rapidly changing smart home. Though it does a good job operating on only basic settings, this Asus router is the one you should look at if you think our pick doesn\\u2019t allow enough customization and you want more settings and sliders to tweak your network. The RT-AX88U was one of the top performers on most of our tests, and we think investing in this model\\u2019s extra performance will pay off if you\\u2019re one of the lucky people who have 500-megabit or faster internet service. The RT-AX88U was faster than our top pick, the TP-Link Archer AX55, on our overall throughput and latency tests. Compared with our top pick, the Asus RT-AX88U has far more RAM (1 GB versus 512 MB) and a faster, quad-core processor, so it would be faster than the AX55 if we were to add more devices to the network. Beyond its day-to-day Wi-Fi improvements, the RT-AX88U justifies its higher price with a long list of upgrades over the Archer AX55 and the other mainstream routers we tested. If you need (or like) to tweak your network settings for specific cases such as gaming or content streaming, or because you need to give critical devices priority over others, the RT-AX88U offers lots of switches and sliders to change those settings in its administration console. If you\\u2019re particularly geeky, note too that the RT-AX88U has other future-proofing improvements, including link aggregation on both the WAN and LAN ports (so it supports faster-than-gigabit speeds on compatible NAS devices and cable modems), two USB 3.1 ports, WPA3 security, and compatibility with Asus\\u2019s AiMesh (which connects compatible routers into a single mesh network). The AX88U also comes with subscription-free AiProtection Pro network protection, which can help manage network traffic to prioritize voice and video communications over gaming, among other options that try to keep the most important things from slowing down. AiProtection Pro\\u2019s internet security helps prevent malware from infecting your phones and PCs, and also offers options intended to filter objectionable content from your children\\u2019s devices. These are services that would cost extra on TP-Link and Netgear routers. If your household is like mine and you\\u2019re adding smart-home devices every year, you\\u2019ll need all the help you can get to control them. Like TP-Link routers, Asus routers include Amazon Alexa compatibility, so you can turn on a separate guest Wi-Fi network using your Echo smart speaker, for example. In addition to supporting Alexa, the Asus RT-AX88U is a little geekier in that it allows you to use IFTTT (If This Then That) to automate functions such as an alert that sends you a check-in email when your kids come home from school and connect their phones to the Wi-Fi. If you don\\u2019t have a gigabit internet plan and those advanced features don\\u2019t sound like things you want to use, the RT-AX88U isn\\u2019t worth the price. And make no mistake, the Asus RT-AX88U is pricey, about double the cost of the TP-Link Archer AX55. More expensive home routers exist, but the next step up from here is practically a commercial-grade router, and in that realm you get features that most people would never touch (and might need an IT degree to understand). Budget pick: TP-Link Archer A8 For smaller spaces or fewer devices The TP-Link Archer A8 is relatively inexpensive and still performs better at close range than pricier models. It\\u2019s a reliable option for a small home or an apartment with a few people and their devices. Our budget pick, the TP-Link Archer A8, uses Wi-Fi 5 (aka 802.11ac), but it worked well with our mix of Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 5 laptops in our tests, and it\\u2019s the router we recommend if you want to spend less than $80 or have a smaller space such as an apartment or a compact home. Our top picks were faster and more reliable at range than the Archer A8, but at shorter ranges it still outperformed some routers costing two to four times as much. Improvements such as WPA3 for additional security and MU-MIMO to better handle multiple devices at the same time make the Archer A8 a better pick than the venerable Archer A7, which we recommended for over three years. The Archer A8 will work with all your current Wi-Fi devices, including smart-home cameras, smart speakers, media streaming boxes, phones, and laptops. We tested the A8 with a mix of Wi-Fi 5 and 6 laptops, and it produced an excellent throughput of 482 Mbps on a Wi-Fi 6 laptop, more than enough for the average cable broadband connection (around 144 Mbps in early 2022, according to Speedtest.net) and faster than the speeds we saw from some Wi-Fi 6 routers like the TP-Link Archer AX21 and D-Link DIR-X1560. The Archer A8 couldn\\u2019t keep that pace at long range in comparison with our top pick and upgrade pick, so we\\u2019re recommending it for smaller spaces. Still, in our tests it posted over 41 Mbps at long range in the garage, a result that would be fast enough to stream a 4K workout video smoothly or to download games at a decent speed to a console such as a Nintendo Switch or a Sony PlayStation 5. That\\u2019s fine for a single TV or streaming box, but if you regularly use multiple devices far from the router, we recommend a more robust router or mesh network. When we tested the Archer A8 on a busy network, it performed admirably, as illustrated in the above chart. This is a good showing\\u2014many of the routers in immediate competition cost up to $200 more than the A8. Note that the value-priced D-Link R15 and our former budget pick, the Archer A7, landed at the bottom of this ranking, far behind the Archer A8. If you find that the A8 works pretty well but can\\u2019t quite reach a stubborn dead zone, you can extend its range with compatible TP-Link OneMesh extenders. Few budget routers support mesh extenders this way, so the feature makes the A8 stand out. However, since it uses the same wireless radios as every other device on your network, it\\u2019s not as adaptable as a mesh-networking kit, which lets you use either wired backhaul or dedicated wireless radios. We tested OneMesh networking for our Wi-Fi extenders guide, and our top pick, the TP-Link RE315, is compatible with the A8. Next to the AX55, the Archer A8 would not offer robust results for a larger home with dozens of devices\\u2014it has less RAM and a weaker processor, and it\\u2019s only Wi-Fi 5 compliant\\u2014but this router is certainly sufficient for a compact home or an apartment with fewer smartphones and PCs. Other good Wi-Fi routers If you have 2.5 gigabit internet service, and have the space for a physically large router: The TP-Link Archer AX90 is really, really big, with eight permanently attached antennas. Thanks to tri-band radios and those antennas, the AX90 was able to top all of our performance test charts (see below), though it wasn\\u2019t significantly faster than the RT-AX88U on most of the tests, and is approximately the same price (around $250). The AX90 also has a 2.5 GbE port for those who are lucky enough to have a modem and internet service above 2 gigabits, and its radio configuration will help you connect additional family phones and smart devices on the congested 5 GHz bands. Drawbacks include a $6 monthly or $55 annual subscription for advanced security and parental controls via the TP-Link HomeShield Pro service (the RT-AX88U includes a free lifetime subscription to AiProtection Pro), and fewer Ethernet ports (three versus the RT-AX88U\\u2019s eight). If you have 2.5 gigabit internet, and have a smaller home: The Asus RT-AX86U is less expensive than the RT-AX88U, but it doesn't match the throughput speed or range of our upgrade pick. It has a 2.5 GbE port, if you have a compatible modem and plan. It shares many features with the RT-AX88U, including the ability to customize Wi-Fi radio settings, AiMesh compatibility, and it includes updated security and advanced parental controls (AiProtection Pro) for the life of the router. The AX86U also earned top marks on our latency test and it has a quad-core processor and 1 GB of RAM, which means it can still handle lots of devices and traffic\\u2014just in a smaller home or office than the AX88U could support. If you want a simpler router and are willing to wait for a sale: The Linksys Hydra 6 showed very little lag or latency on our tests, showing up in second or third place, right behind the chart-topping TP-Link AX90 described above. It has mixed results on the throughput tests; it\\u2019s not the fastest at close range but surpasses more expensive routers when you move further away. When we tested the Hydra 6, it was at a low price of around $150 and was a contender for the top pick. We didn\\u2019t award the Hydra 6 the top pick this time around because it is a relatively new product with scant third-party reviews, and because the router\\u2019s price subsequently bounced back to its MSRP of $180. We\\u2019ll keep an eye on the Hydra 6\\u2019s price and reputation. It has the potential to be a top pick, but for now we can only recommend it if it\\u2019s on sale for $150 or less. Every time we do a router review or a mesh-networking guide, readers ask us about enterprise-level networking options like Ubiquiti\\u2019s UniFi networking line. Although its rack-mounted models are decidedly overkill for most homes, we were intrigued by the UniFi Dream Machine (UDM), which seems tailor-made for homes and small businesses. The UDM has a built-in Wi-Fi 5 access point, whereas Ubiquiti\\u2019s more enterprise-level options separate the router and access-point functions into different boxes (and saddle them with enterprise-level prices). The UDM also has the single gigabit WAN port and four gigabit LAN ports that most home-level routers use. A couple of nice unique features: The power supply is built in (no wall-wart AC adapter necessary), and the UDM has an internal fan to quell overheating. The UDM\\u2019s administration app and web interface look polished and professional compared with those of home routers, and they offer plenty of settings and graphic monitors familiar to network engineers; to folks who just want a simple-to-use router, Ubiquiti\\u2019s interface could look like an impenetrable wall of technical details. The UDM did okay on our tests, though the Asus RT-AX88U was able to outperform it. In particular, the UDM was less responsive on a vital test\\u2014long-distance latency on a busy network\\u2014than the Asus. Even the far less expensive TP-Link Archer AX55, our top pick, performed better than the UDM in some situations. In an addendum to our mesh-networking guide, we found that a Ubiquiti setup with wired UAP access points outperformed a top mesh-networking kit in wireless-only mode. We also tested the Ubiquiti UniFi Dream Router (UDR), a Wi-Fi 6 follow-up to the UDM. The Dream Router has a similar white shell and adds a front-facing info screen that gives you real-time stats about your internet connection. The UDR also adds a pair of PoE (power over Ethernet) ports for Ethernet-powered access points and webcams. The Dream Router performed better on our tests than the UDM, but still finished mid pack, far below our upgrade pick and routers we also recommend below. It\\u2019s a solid base unit for a professional UniFi mesh network, but it\\u2019s an expensive and overly complicated standalone router for most people. How we tested, plus the results Testing for most Wi-Fi router reviews consists mostly of connecting a single device to Wi-Fi at various distances, trying to get the biggest throughput number possible, and declaring the router with the biggest number and the best range the winner, at least in terms of raw performance. The problem with this method is that it assumes that a big number for one connected device divides evenly into bigger numbers for all connected devices. This is usually a valid assumption for wired networking, but it doesn\\u2019t work well for Wi-Fi. Because we were testing in the real world, external variables (competing signals, walls, network traffic) affected our results, just as they\\u2019re likely to affect yours. The purpose of our testing was not to choose a router that was slightly faster than another; it was to see which routers could deliver consistently strong performance without encountering major issues in real-world conditions. Instead of running just a single speed test, we used four laptops at different distances from the router in a 2,300-square-foot, two-story suburban home to simulate the real-world activity of a busy home network. Because these tests simulated real-world traffic, they did a better job of modeling real-world performance compared with a tool like iPerf, an artificial testing utility that moves data from one machine to another as fast as possible. We also made sure to enable each router\\u2019s load-balancing band-steering feature, when applicable, to make sure that the routers would properly distribute our client laptops across all available bands to improve performance. We didn\\u2019t touch most of the other settings\\u2014you should be able to connect to your Wi-Fi and have it work without constantly fiddling with things. We used a mix of 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) USB Wi-Fi adapters and 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) internal Wi-Fi adapters to simulate a home network serving different clients. For example, most recent Windows laptops as well as top-of-the-line phones such as the latest iPhone and Samsung models have Wi-Fi 6 wireless radios, while budget smartphones, older laptops, or smart speakers are likely to be on Wi-Fi 5. Newer phones and laptops support Wi-Fi 6E (see our FAQs below), and we\\u2019re planning to add 6E testing to our laptops in 2023. Our four laptops ran the following tests: One sat in the downstairs master bedroom and simulated a 4K video streaming session. It tried to download data at up to 30 Mbps, but we were satisfied if it could average 25 Mbps or better, which is what Disney+ recommends for 4K UHD. The second sat in the garage and simulated a web-browsing session. Once every 20 seconds or so, it downloaded 16 files of 128 KB each simultaneously to simulate loading a modern web page; ideally pages should load in less than 750 milliseconds. The third laptop sat in the living room across the house, simulating a second browsing session. It also downloaded 16 128 KB files simultaneously, and on this laptop we looked for the same quick load times. The last laptop sat in a spare bedroom downstairs at close range and downloaded a very large file. We didn\\u2019t care about latency\\u2014the amount of time between when the computer made a request and when the router responded to it\\u2014for this large-file download, but we did want to see an overall throughput of 100 Mbps or better. We ran all these tests at the same time for a full five minutes to simulate a realistic extra-busy time on a home network. Although your network probably isn\\u2019t always that busy, it is that busy often enough\\u2014and those busy times are when you\\u2019re most likely to get annoyed, so they\\u2019re what we were modeling in our tests. We ran each test six times, and we then averaged the results to smooth out spikes. The mix of these tests and devices let us evaluate each router\\u2019s speed (throughput), range, and ability to multitask (latency or lag). To test the router\\u2019s best possible speeds at close range, we placed one of our test laptops approximately 15 feet from the router, with one interior ceiling between router and laptop; we also performed a long-distance maximum-throughput test at about 50 feet, with four interior and two exterior walls in the way. We tested throughput using a real HTTP download, the same protocol you use to view websites and download files, to better expose differences in CPU speed and general routing performance. We characterized speed by looking at the combination of performance when downloading a large file at short and long range. The majority of the routers were able to top 500 Mbps at close distances, with some of the best-performing routers, like the Asus RT-AX88U, reaching over 640 Mbps. Only a couple of stragglers (the TP-Link Archer AX10 and D-Link DIR-X1560) fell far behind at 100 Mbps. Note that we saw these speeds on a connection between two PCs on the routers\\u2019 Wi-Fi network. Your internet service plan acts as a speed limit on your connection to the internet. For example, if you\\u2019re paying for only a 50 Mbps service plan, 50 Mbps is the best you can expect when you\\u2019re downloading from the internet. Folks on a gigabit plan (a 1,000 Mbps connection) are more likely to be able to max out their connection speeds using any of the top routers. Looking at just the throughput speed results of our long-range laptop\\u2014the one we had in the garage four rooms and five walls away from the router\\u2014we would surmise that the D-Link R15 is a bargain, but the latency charts below show that its performance is less impressive when it\\u2019s stressed by multiple devices. Our pick, the TP-Link Archer AX55, was slightly slower in this test but more consistently good overall. Multitasking (latency or lag) Speed isn\\u2019t everything, so in addition to evaluating throughput, we measured latency on a busy network. Latency refers to the time you spend between clicking on a link and waiting for the next web page, streaming video, or file download to come through. We ran this test concurrently on two laptops while other laptops were downloading files and simulating a 4K video stream, further stressing the Wi-Fi network. During our multi-client latency testing, we looked at how well a router performed typically (the median) as well as how poorly it did ramping down to its worst moments (shown through the middle to the left side of the chart, marked \\u201cMax\\u201d). This procedure allowed us to determine how frequently and how much the experience may frustrate you. The top routers here passed this test with flying colors: Linksys Hydra 6 (MR20EC) Linksys Hydra Pro 6E (MR7500) Linksys Hydra Pro 6 (MR5500) Any of them will give you good to great responsiveness while you\\u2019re browsing, even while other family members or devices are using your network\\u2019s bandwidth. The routers near the bottom of this ranking, such as the TP-Link Archer A8 and Archer A7, still performed admirably but started to show increased latency (they petered out) quicker than the leaders. Our median latency chart shows the typical latency for every computer on our test network at once, offering some idea of how the whole network will usually perform when you have multiple devices making requests at the same time. Each color bar represents a task waiting for something to happen after you\\u2019ve clicked a link, and longer bars mean you\\u2019ll spend more time staring at a spinning circle or pinwheel. Again, the Asus RT-AX88U was able to speedily serve each client simultaneously, with a minimal wait between each request. The TP-Link Archer AX55 wasn\\u2019t far behind. At the bottom of the chart, the longer browsing bars for the TP-Link Archer AX21 and Linksys E7350 show that you\\u2019ll be sitting there waiting for a few seconds (or more) if other devices are stressing the network at the same time. Consistently having to wait a few seconds for something to happen is the definition of slow internet. Router setup and network maintenance Regardless of the router you\\u2019re using, you need to do a few things to maintain a secure, reliable wireless connection: To access your router\\u2019s web-based configuration screen, don\\u2019t use any domain names that your router\\u2019s manufacturer may have provided as a shortcut\\u2014such domain names have been known to get hijacked and can open you up to attack. Instead, connect a desktop or laptop to the router (wired or wireless), open a web browser, and type in the router\\u2019s IP address; here\\u2019s how to find it. As soon as you set up your router, change its administrator password. Use WPA2-PSK (AES) encryption for the best speed and security on your Wi-Fi networks. (Use your router\\u2019s mixed-mode setting\\u2014AES and TKIP\\u2014only if you have older devices that don\\u2019t support WPA2.) WPA3 is a newer security standard that purports to be more secure, but very few WPA3-compatible devices are available so far. WPA3 is backward-compatible with WPA2, so you\\u2019re fine to use it if your router has it. When we evaluated our test group, if a router had WPA3, we added points for that future-proofing. Immediately check for any available firmware updates for your router and then recheck every few months. Updating will help you ensure that you get the best performance, security, and reliability. Any of our picks (the TP-Link Archer AX55, the Asus RT-AX88U, or the TP-Link Archer A8) will alert you to new firmware updates when you open the web-based administration page, but you usually have to open that page regularly to check. Some routers prompt you to use their cloud login service, which usually requires online sign-up; once you do sign up, you can set the router to automatically update its firmware as new versions become available. If you\\u2019re interested in some straightforward steps you can take to make your router more secure, we like this guide by SwiftOnSecurity. Try to place your router in a central location in your home. Don\\u2019t stash it in a closet next to a bunch of other electronics, and don\\u2019t just shove it somewhere in the basement. Don\\u2019t waste your time wiggling the antennas around\\u2014they\\u2019re omnidirectional. You can\\u2019t get more than a 1 or 2 dBm gain (or loss) from a different antenna position, and that isn\\u2019t enough to fix any Wi-Fi problems you might be having. Don\\u2019t just connect everything to your router\\u2019s 5 GHz radio \\u201cbecause it\\u2019s faster.\\u201d Yes, 5 GHz is faster than 2.4 GHz\\u2014at short range, at least. But the more devices you cram onto a single radio, the more problems you\\u2019ll encounter. Note that tri-band routers have two 5 GHz radios, so you can connect critical devices such as a streaming set-top box or a gaming PC to its own 5 GHz radio manually. If you don\\u2019t have or aren\\u2019t using band steering, be sure to manually connect your devices to all the bands your router offers. Wi-Fi 6E\\u2019s 6 GHz channel is a unique case right now: There are few laptops and phones that can even use the 6 GHz bands, and in the 6E routers we\\u2019ve seen so far, you have to connect to the channels manually. To optimize your network, grab an app such as Wi-Fi Analytics (PC/Android), WiFi Analyzer (Android, open source) or WiFi Explorer (Mac) to make sure you\\u2019ve configured your Wi-Fi networks correctly. See whether competing wireless networks are present on channels 1, 6, and 11 on the 2.4 GHz band, or if any other Wi-Fi networks are on the 5 GHz band. If you\\u2019re having frequent problems with lots of signal bars but slow speeds, try changing to a different Wi-Fi channel\\u2014but don\\u2019t get too hung up on which channel seems to have the most networks visible. Active Wi-Fi use is what causes congestion: One neighboring network with kids home and playing all day, for example, might give you more trouble than three neighboring networks with little or no activity. If your laptop is having problems connecting to your router, make sure that you have the latest drivers for your laptop\\u2019s Wi-Fi card. You can usually find the drivers on your laptop manufacturer\\u2019s website, but the Wi-Fi card\\u2019s manufacturer might have more-recent drivers. We encountered this issue once during our previous testing: One of our laptops, an Acer, would connect to a router\\u2019s wireless-ac network but drop the speeds to almost nothing. When we updated our Acer laptop with Wi-Fi drivers straight from Intel, which were newer than the ones Acer offered, our problem went away. What to look forward to We\\u2019re keeping track of gear that is Wi-Fi 6E compatible. This expanded wireless standard takes advantage of deregulated 6 GHz radio frequencies. Laptops and phones that are 6 GHz compatible are still rare, but we think the new bands will be useful for wireless backhaul between a router and satellites (such as in a mesh-networking kit). So far, Asus has released the ROG Rapture GT-AXE11000 gaming router, but others, including the TP-Link Archer AX96, AXE200 Omni, and Archer AX206, will follow. The next iteration of wireless networking, Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) has been announced, and the first few Wi-Fi 7 routers from TP-Link will be released soon. We\\u2019ll test them when they\\u2019re available, but like with Wi-Fi 6E, we\\u2019d wait until Wi-Fi 7 is available on more laptops, phones, and tablets before we recommend upgrading your router to Wi-Fi 7. Wired connections are improving as well. Routers supporting 2.5-, 5-, and 10-GbE (gigabit Ethernet) connections promise faster transfers than the 1 GbE ports found on most current laptops, desktops, and media streaming boxes. You\\u2019ll have to wait until your next PCs, NAS, and media boxes support these faster standards in order to partake of the faster speeds, but some business routers like the QNAP QHora-301W already support up to 10 GbE. What is a Wi-Fi router? And other frequently asked questions A typical home network today doesn\\u2019t look like networks did a few years ago. Without even getting into the explosion of smart-home devices (everything from smart light bulbs to doorbells to washing machines now relies on a decent Wi-Fi connection), most homes these days have two or more personal Wi-Fi devices (phone, laptop, tablet) per person, as well as smart TVs or a media streaming box such as a Roku or an Apple TV. A busy evening in a typical home could have one person downloading game updates in a bedroom, a second listening to music from a smart speaker, a third watching TV in the living room, and a fourth browsing the web while sitting on the couch\\u2014and all of that traffic demands a router that can provide fast performance for lots of devices at once. The resulting network congestion that such homes experience has made us a lot pickier about what routers we accept as the best for the most people, as well as a lot more interested in features such as Wi-Fi 6 support and mesh compatibility. These features cost more, but they\\u2019re worth the expense. A router is a box that connects your home network to the internet, through your cable modem or fiber internet connection. All communication on the internet, whether it\\u2019s a website, a streaming movie, a FaceTime video call, or an email message, is made of data packets. The router takes the signals from your modem (see below) and determines that a streaming movie you\\u2019re watching is this group of data packets and is meant to be routed to your iPad. Or that another group of packets is an email that you will be reading and responding to on your laptop. Most current home routers handle both wireless (Wi-Fi) and wired (Ethernet) connections. What is the difference between a modem and a router? As mentioned in our guide to modems vs. routers, a modem is a box that connects your home network to your internet service provider, or ISP. A router is a box that lets all of your wired and wireless devices use that internet connection at once and allows them to talk to one another directly. Think of the modem as the box that deals with all the data packets to and from the outside world, and the router as the one that deals with all the communication inside your home (or business). What are dual-band routers and tri-band routers, and what\\u2019s the difference between them? Although all modern routers are at least dual band\\u2014offering one slower but longer-range 2.4 GHz band and one faster but shorter-range 5 GHz band\\u2014it\\u2019s not easy to take full advantage of both bands. On most cheap (or old) routers, you have to make two separate network names\\u2014such as \\u201cmynetwork2.4\\u201d and \\u201cmynetwork5\\u201d\\u2014and then decide which of your devices should join which network. If you don\\u2019t give your networks different names (SSIDs), in practice all your devices end up piling onto one 5 GHz band, and you experience slower speeds, delays, and even dropped connections when several of them are online and busy at the same time. Tri-band routers have an extra 5 GHz band or 6 GHz band in addition to the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands of a dual-band router. This third band allows more devices to connect and be busy at once without slowing the network down so much. Band steering\\u2014specifically load-balancing band steering\\u2014lets you use a single network name for all your Wi-Fi bands and allows the router to decide which devices go on 2.4 GHz and which ones go on 5 GHz or 6 GHz, based on where they are in your house and how much bandwidth they\\u2019re using. Band steering is essential for mesh networks, which have multiple access points and multiple bands to deal with, but the feature is important even in standalone routers, because if you aren\\u2019t using all the radios in your router, you aren\\u2019t getting all the performance you paid for. Load-balancing band steering becomes even more important with tri-band routers\\u2014that extra radio won\\u2019t do you any good if none of your devices are connected to it. Right now, you don\\u2019t have to have your own router if you subscribe to 5G home internet. What\\u2019s the difference between a regular router and a mesh router? A regular or standalone router is just that, it stands alone, and sends data packets (streaming videos, music, Slack messages, etc.) from a central location in your home to all your wired (Ethernet) and wireless (Wi-Fi) devices. A mesh network is a system of two to four boxes\\u2014usually sold together\\u2014that work together to relay the Wi-Fi signal around your house or business. Those boxes might be called mesh routers, mesh extenders, satellites, or nodes, depending on the manufacturer. You\\u2019d want to use a mesh network if the Wi-Fi signals from a single router are too weak to reach all the corners of your home, causing dropouts. Is an AC1750 router slower than an AC1900 router? All 802.11ac and 802.11ax routers come with an AC or AX speed rating meant to tell you how fast the router is, formatted as \\u201cAC1900\\u201d or \\u201cAX3000,\\u201d for example. The bad news is that AC and AX speed ratings are really, really bogus. In the real world, for example, AC2300, AC1900, and AC1750 all mean pretty much the same thing: a dual-band router with one 2.4 GHz radio and one 5 GHz radio, each supporting up to three spatial streams\\u2014concurrent connections that the router can combine to increase the throughput available to your device, similar to adding lanes to a highway. A rating of AC2600 indicates a dual-band router with four spatial streams each, and a rating of AC3200 means a tri-band router with three spatial streams each, and so on. Testing in real-world situations (as we do above) is more effective than skimming AC or AX ratings to see how each router compares to one another. What is a 4x4 router, and what is MU-MIMO? When you see a router advertised as 2\\u00d72, 3\\u00d73, or 4\\u00d74, those pairs of numbers refer to the number of transmitters and receivers the radio has, with which the router can communicate over the spatial streams. The kicker here is that the phones, laptops, game consoles, and other devices you\\u2019re using are almost always 1\\u00d71 or 2\\u00d72 (so they support either one or two spatial streams, respectively), and the speed of the connection is determined by the device with the fewest spatial streams. A 2\\u00d72 laptop wouldn\\u2019t get any more throughput from a 4\\u00d74 router than it would from a 2\\u00d72 router, though it would still get twice as much as a 1\\u00d71 laptop. What about using those extra streams to connect to another device at the same time? For the most part, that\\u2019s a no-go. You might have a 2\\u00d72 laptop, a 2\\u00d72 phone, and a 4\\u00d74 router\\u2014but unless all three of them support a technology called MU-MIMO, the router can talk to only one of them at once, using only two streams. With MU-MIMO, the router could talk to the phone using two streams and to the laptop using the other two, simultaneously. Routers with MU-MIMO support are common but not necessarily ubiquitous; same with client devices. So having MU-MIMO support\\u2014and more than three spatial streams\\u2014in your router is nice for future compatibility. What are Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6? In October 2018, the Wi-Fi Alliance, an industry organization responsible for certifying that Wi-Fi devices work together, announced that it was rebranding Wi-Fi 802.11n as \\u201cWi-Fi 4,\\u201d 802.11ac as \\u201cWi-Fi 5,\\u201d and 802.11ax as \\u201cWi-Fi 6.\\u201d We hope the new terminology will help simplify explanations. Wi-Fi 6 brings improvements that we\\u2019re hoping will help routers and mesh networks better handle the increasing number of wireless devices, using technologies like OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) and TWT (Target Wake Time); however, devices must be Wi-Fi 6 compliant to take full advantage of them. Most new laptops, tablets, and phones now support Wi-Fi 6, but budget phones, tablets, and smart devices are stuck with Wi-Fi 5. What about Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7? Wi-Fi 6E is an extension of Wi-Fi 6. It uses many of the same technologies but adds them to the 6 GHz radio band. As with Wi-Fi 6, you can use Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 4 devices with Wi-Fi 6E routers. However, unless you just upgraded to top-of-the-line Android phones, MacBook Pros, and Windows laptops, you probably don\\u2019t have Wi-Fi 6E devices in your home to take advantage of these premium routers\\u2019 6 GHz connectivity features. Wi-Fi 7 (aka 802.11be) is the newest of the Wi-Fi technologies. Like Wi-Fi 6E, it uses the 6 GHz radio band in addition to the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio bands. Wi-Fi 7 promises to improve throughput and bandwidth by widening the radio channels (320 MHz channels), more efficiently packing those channels with data (4K QAM), allowing connections on two separate channels simultaneously (MLO), and being able to transfer data in unused portions of an otherwise congested channel (Multi-RU puncturing). We\\u2019ll of course test these claims when Wi-Fi 7 laptops become available, but suffice to say Wi-Fi 7 is engineered to increase speeds and function efficiently in an increasingly crowded wireless environment. How do I choose between Wi-Fi 5, Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7? Some buyers will always go for the latest technology, but that\\u2019s not always the wisest course. In 2023, we think most people should buy a Wi-Fi 6 router or mesh network. Wi-Fi 5 routers are totally usable if you want to save some money, but Wi-Fi 6 has reached a mainstream saturation point where it gives you the best performance for a moderate amount of money. Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 routers are forward-looking and may be relevant for a longer period of time, but in order to make the most use of either technology you\\u2019ll have to upgrade your laptops, tablets, and phones as well. Wi-Fi 7 routers in particular are expensive, and you\\u2019ll have to wait to reap their benefits fully. Wi-Fi 7 routers were introduced this year, but they\\u2019re running on so-called draft versions of Wi-Fi 7. They should work, but they\\u2019re being released before the standard has been fully certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance, a group that guarantees that wireless devices work with each other and that they will be able to use all the functions advertised. Wi-Fi 7\\u2019s time will likely come, but it\\u2019s not here yet. 5G is a sometimes-confusing term, because \\u201c5G\\u201d is used for two different and separate wireless technologies. 5G can refer to the 5 GHz band in your dual- or tri-band router (see above). About every Wi-Fi router sold today has a 5 GHz band. 5G also refers to 5G cellular technology, which is faster than 4G LTE. 5G cellular is used for current smartphones, and for 5G home internet service from ISPs like T-Mobile and Verizon. 5G home internet can bridge that \\u201clast-mile\\u201d connection between the ISP and your home, potentially replacing the coaxial (cable TV) or fiber connection drilled into the side of your apartment building or house. Right now, you don\\u2019t have to buy your own router if you subscribe to 5G home internet. T-Mobile and Verizon will provide a 5G home router with Wi-Fi 6 so you can use the service right away. What to look forward to The next iteration of wireless networking, Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) has been announced, and the first few Wi-Fi 7 routers from TP-Link will be released soon, including the Archer GE800, Archer BE800, Archer BE805, and Archer BE550. Asus announced the ROG Rapture GT BE-98 gaming router with Wi-Fi 7, and MSI has announced the RadiX BE22000 Turbo Wi-Fi 7 router. Most of these are top-of-the-line routers, and we expect them to be priced accordingly. Like Wi-Fi 6 and 6E, Wi-Fi 7 promises faster speeds and will accommodate more simultaneous connections than Wi-Fi 5. We\\u2019ll test these claims when they\\u2019re available, but like with Wi-Fi 6E, we\\u2019d wait until Wi-Fi 7 is available on more laptops, phones, and tablets before we recommend upgrading your router to Wi-Fi 7. The TP-Link Archer AX50 and AX20 were our former top pick and runner-up, respectively. They were recently discontinued by the manufacturer. They may still be available via third-party sales, but we recommend that you don\\u2019t buy them. If you already own one, they will continue to provide solid Wi-Fi service, but future firmware updates are not guaranteed. The Synology RT2600ac was our runner-up in a previous guide, and it also proved itself competitive this time. However, our new picks outpaced the Synology on price and in our performance tests overall. We still recommend the RT2600ac for folks who love to fiddle with their network settings or those who suspect that they will need to expand their network with a mesh node in the future. The TP-Link Archer A7 was our budget pick in a previous version of this guide and has been serving strong networks in the homes of several Wirecutter staffers. However, the A7 is starting to show its age compared with newer options. Our new budget pick, the Archer A8, offers better performance overall for about the same price, and it adds features such as WPA3 and MU-MIMO, which the A7 lacks. The gaming-oriented TP-Link Archer GX90 was just behind the Archer AX90 in our performance tests overall. It is certainly one to consider if you have a gamer in your home, plus the router is ready for 2.5 Gbps internet. However, its styling calls attention to itself, with eight red-accented antennas sticking out of its body, and it is overkill unless you absolutely need its gaming optimizations. Asus\\u2019s ROG Rapture GT-AX6000 is another gaming router we looked at recently. It has RGB color lighting on its body and four large antennas that are very visible, so it\\u2019s not a router you hide behind a ceramic pot (not that you should do that to any wireless router). Its performance was close to the Archer AX50, which is to say very good, but not necessarily a better buy than upgrade picks like the Asus RT-AX88U. Fans of the Synology RT2600ac may be interested in the Wi-Fi 6 Synology RT6600ax. Like its forebear, it straddles the space between a high-end router for consumers and one that is capable of serving the internet to a small business like a coffee shop or family restaurant. It can be linked with other RT6600ax routers to make a mesh network, though that could get pricey quickly. The RT6600ax was an above average performer on our tests, and it tested well in our latest mesh guide update. The Linksys Hydra Pro 6 (MR5500) is a Wi-Fi 6 counterpart to the Hydra Pro 6E detailed below. It lacks a 6 GHz radio, like most of the routers here, and has a basic user interface for folks who want a simpler router to set up. It can be expanded to a mesh network with Linksys Velop mesh nodes, or other Linksys Intelligent Mesh routers. It performed on our tests as well as the TP-Link Archer AX20, which costs half as much, so we\\u2019ve placed the MR5500 here among the rest of the competition. The TP-Link Archer AX10 and D-Link DIR-X1560 were our budget router contenders. Both had tri-core CPUs, but both seemed not to utilize them well, as both finished behind the single-core Archer A7 and A8 in our tests. The DIR-X1560 in particular lost points for having a stripped-down administration interface that looked as if it came from a 2012-era router, not from a 2020 model. The D-Link R15 is a mesh-capable router, but it uses the new Eagle Pro AI mesh system, which is incompatible with the Covr and Exo mesh systems that D-Link has rolled out in the past. In our tests, the R15 showed excellent throughput at range with one laptop, but its performance was merely okay when we put the router under duress with multiple laptops running simultaneously. The R15 is priced competitively with our budget pick at this writing, but the Archer A8 has a longer, two-year warranty (double that of the R15), and TP-Link\\u2019s OneMesh model lines have many more router and extender options than the Eagle Pro AI mesh system: D-Link has only one Eagle Pro AI extender compatible with two routers, while TP-Link has 13 OneMesh extenders compatible with over 19 routers. The Linksys MR7350 and Netgear RAX40 are moderately priced Wi-Fi 6 routers. You can expand the MR7350 using Linksys\\u2019s Velop mesh nodes, and Netgear\\u2019s RAX40 was one of the first affordable 802.11ax routers. In our tests, both performed in the middle of the pack but didn\\u2019t distinguish themselves over the TP-Link Archer AX50 or AX20. Both the Linksys and Netgear routers have short, one-year warranties. With its RGB gamer-inspired light panel and customizable light show, the Asus ROG GT-AC2900 stood out visually. Priced just above the Netgear RAX40, it was a strong performer in our tests, and it offered multiple QoS settings to tweak its network for gaming. The TP-Link Archer AX6000 has eight retractable antennas that make it look like an upside-down spider. Those antennas helped the router place well in our long-range throughput test, but the rest of its performance numbers were closer to middling. The AX6000 is notable for having a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port, for those who own a compatible modem, but on the whole the Asus RT-AX88U is a better pick. We tested the Linksys E5600, E7350, and E8450. Ranging in price from about $40 to $150, these three routers share an antenna-less angular design, but were poor performers overall. The E5600 and E7350 notably were at the bottom of our performance charts. Neither router supports smart connect (aka band steering), and each has a short, one-year warranty. The D-Link DIR-X1870 and DIR-X5460 shared a very basic web-based user interface with very few settings. The DIR-X1870 experienced errors during testing, which caused clients to drop off the network, while the DIR-X5460 was in the mid-to-bottom tier on our performance tests. Like Linksys routers, the D-Link routers have a shorter, one-year warranty. The Netgear RAX20 was promising on paper, with a quad-core processor and a $100 price, but it performed worse than the $60 TP-Link Archer A7, our former budget pick. Likewise, the Netgear RAX50 had middling results but was more expensive than other routers we tested. The RAX70\\u2019s performance sat near the top of our testing, but its $100-per-year subscription for the Netgear Armor security suite, a short one-year warranty with only 90 days of tech support, a lack of mesh support, and no 2.5 GbE port left the RAX70 behind the TP-Link Archer AX90 and Asus RT-AX88U. Asus routers like the RT-AX55, RT-AX3000 (aka RT-AX58U), RT-AX68U, and RT-AX82U tested well but were worse than our picks for one reason or another. For example, the RT-AX55 was competitive with the TP-Link Archer AX20 for approximately the same price, but was significantly worse at the long-distance throughput test. The RT-AX82U was also in our bottom third at the long distance test. The TP-Link Archer AX21 finished at or near the bottom of our charts and was notably one of the slowest in our long-distance testing (5.4 Mbps, far too slow for 4K streaming, for example). The Archer AX73 fared better than the AX21 but finished behind the Archer AX55 overall. The AX73 is $30 to $50 more expensive than the AX55. We tested the TP-Link Archer AX75 and the Archer AXE75. Both are somewhat easy to confuse with each other: They have almost identical names, the same styling, and similar prices around $150 to $200, depending if they\\u2019re on sale or not. Both are tri-band, though the AXE75 has a 6 GHz radio for Wi-Fi 6E, while the AX75 two 5 GHz radios and Wi-Fi 6. Oddly enough, the AXE75 has the faster Wi-Fi 6E radios but lacks a fast 2.5 GbE Ethernet port. The AX75 has the slower Wi-Fi 5 and also lacks 2.5 GbE. Both routers performed way above average, and either choice is fine at about $150, but neither is a good bargain at $190 to $200. Netgear\\u2019s Nighthawk RAXE300 (AXE7800) performed at or near the top of our charts, and visually makes a statement. Unlike the ugly antennas on most of the routers here, Netgear built the router\\u2019s antennas into wings on the sides of the router\\u2019s body. The RAXE300\\u2019s Wi-Fi performance is exemplary, but so is its price. At around $400, it\\u2019s hard to recommend it compared to our upgrade pick, particularly when you consider that the Asus RT-AX88U comes with a two-year warranty, while the Netgear makes do with one. Also Netgear will charge for its optional Armor security package after the first year, while Asus includes a lifetime subscription to its AiProtection Pro service for free. The Netgear RAXE500 and the Linksys Hydra Pro 6E are pricey Wi-Fi 6E routers. Although both are powerful and offer very good to excellent range\\u2014the RAXE500 ranked at or close to the top of three of our four performance metrics\\u2014both models cost much more than most people need to spend. If you\\u2019re a bleeding-edge tech buff with deep pockets, we\\u2019d give a slight nod to the RAXE500, but most people should wait until Wi-Fi 6E becomes more prevalent.

Learn more \\u203a If your home\\u2019s wireless internet network is flaky, or certain rooms of your home have been dubbed \\u201cdead zones,\\u201d an underpowered Wi-Fi router is probably to blame. This is especially true if you live with multiple people with an ever-growing list of devices. It\\u2019s often no longer sufficient to rely on the router/modem combo provided by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) for good service. Investing in one of the best Wi-Fi routers will guarantee you\\u2019ll have a strong, fast, consistent internet connection throughout your entire home. Best overall: eero Pro 6E Best for gaming: NETGEAR Nighthawk Pro XR1000 Gaming Wi-Fi 6 Router Best Wi-Fi 6: eero 6+ Best mesh: Linksys MX8503 Atlas Wi-Fi 6E Wi-Fi Mesh System Best long-range: TP-Link Deco AX3000 Best portable: NETGEAR Nighthawk M1 Best budget: Vilo Mesh Wi-Fi System How we chose the best Wi-Fi routers A Wi-Fi router is the bedrock of your connected home and arguably the gadget you\\u2019ll rely on most throughout the day, so stability is paramount. We\\u2019ve done a mix of research and hands-on testing to determine which Wi-Fi routers to select for this guide, factoring in the size of your home, how many devices you have, the main reasons you\\u2019ll use the internet, and how much you\\u2019d like to spend. The good news is that there\\u2019s never been a better time to get a Wi-Fi router. Companies have upped their game substantially, making their networking gear more sophisticated and easier to use. The best Wi-Fi routers will receive regular updates to continually improve their security and gain new features, but download and install them at a time when you won\\u2019t be interrupted. You can set up and manage these routers using apps rather than logging into them using an IP address\\u2014we\\u2019ve been there, and it\\u2019s not fun\\u2014which is especially handy for troubleshooting. Even budget-priced entry-level routers have these features, which is a good sign that home networking is being taken seriously. Finding the best Wi-Fi router amidst all this competition can be tough, but that\\u2019s why we\\u2019re here to help. The best Wi-Fi routers: Reviews & Recommendations The sudden rise of remote work and school, combined with everything from security systems to speakers to countertop ovens to toothbrushes becoming internet-connected and \\u201csmart,\\u201d has put a strain on aging networking gear. Various ISPs (Verizon, Comcast, Spectrum) can offer good modem-router combos, but if you don\\u2019t research carefully, you might find that comes at a higher cost with lower capabilities. Our selection of Wi-Fi routers comes from a wide variety of well-known and trusted brands that can relieve bandwidth congestion. Each router has a specific feature that helps it stand out, but all of them clear a set bar of quality. You\\u2019re sure to find one that fits your needs and budget. Best overall: eero Pro 6E Brandt Ranj / Popular Science Range: 6000 square feet Supports the latest Wi-Fi version Easy to set up and manage Eero continues to make the best Wi-Fi routers for most people over six years after its hardware debuted and brought mesh Wi-Fi routers into the mainstream. In our tests, which included uploading and downloading large files while streaming video on a TV and downloading digital games on the Nintendo Switch, we never felt a reduction in performance. Granted, our tests were conducted using a Gigabit fiber optic internet connection, so your results will vary based on your internet package. We were sent a two-pack of Eero Pro 6E routers and mostly stuck to using one, which covered all but the deepest reaches of a three-floor condo. We only had trouble in one far-off room on a different floor from the router, which necessitated installing the second router. The second router eliminated that one dead zone and improved the consistency of our network overall. If you have thin walls, there\\u2019s no reason why one of eero\\u2019s routers would be sufficient for your entire space. You always have the option to add additional eero routers to your home network since this is a mesh Wi-Fi system. Setting up and configuring an Eero remains as straightforward as it ever has. The company\\u2019s app is world-class and makes the process seamless. We were guided through all the necessary steps to get up and running: Plugging eero\\u2019s router into an outlet, connecting it to our cable modem using an Ethernet cable, and waiting for its LED to flash blue, which let us know it was ready for setup. The only information you\\u2019ll need to enter is your desired network name and password. Once the router is configured, it\\u2019ll ask whether you want to set up any additional hardware and automatically check for a software update. In our opinion, this is the way home networking hardware should always work. Eero\\u2019s routers do all the heavy lifting, with minimal\\u2014if any\\u2014maintenance needed to keep your network going. Another positive feature eero has going for it is the overall design of its hardware. These routers have no antennas, nor are they tall, monolith-like beasts that\\u2019ll draw unwanted attention from guests. The squat, bulbous Wi-Fi routers can sit on a desk or next to a cable modem without looking out of place. Security-conscious users will appreciate the Pro 6E\\u2019s support of WPA3 and the option to fortify their network further with eero Plus. The paid service costs $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year and includes the ability to block ads, set up content filters, or block apps at the Wi-Fi router level. This means you won\\u2019t have to set specific parental controls on children\\u2019s devices or worry about them using a potentially malicious app on a smartphone or tablet. Eero Plus also includes subscriptions to 1Password (a password manager), Encrypt.me (a VPN), and Malwarebyte (antivirus software), to further protect internet-connected hardware on your network. Eero\\u2019s Pro 6E routers have a pretty steep price tag\\u2014especially if you opt for the three-router package\\u2014but this is the type of big up-front, one-time purchase that\\u2019s well worth the money. Once these Wi-Fi routers are set up, you won\\u2019t have to worry about having a good internet connection again. We\\u2019re also encouraged by the fact that Eero supports its hardware for a very long time. Its first-generation routers received software updates and security patches until early this year. Eero also offers a 25% discount on its newer routers when you trade in old ones, which is a more useful (environmentally-friendly) option than throwing them out or keeping them in a drawer. Best for gaming: NETGEAR Nighthawk Pro XR1000 Gaming Wi-Fi 6 Router Range: 2500 square feet Wi-Fi version: Wi-Fi 6 A USB port for use as a media server Four Ethernet ports for wired connections Its look is slightly garish A strong, stable internet connection is imperative for online gaming, and if you can get beyond its confusing name and garish look, there\\u2019s a lot to like about NETGEAR\\u2019s Nighthawk Pro XR1000 Gaming Wi-Fi 6 Router. Its marquee feature is its top speed of 5.4Gbps, which guarantees lag-free wireless gaming if your internet package is fast enough. The Wi-Fi router is also equipped with four Ethernet ports if you want to wire up your gaming PC and three consoles for even lower latency (lag). These Ethernet ports are complimented by a USB port, which allows you to hook up an external hard drive and use this router as a media or file server. Many people won\\u2019t take advantage of that feature, but it\\u2019s nice to have. Wireless networking has always been too slow for many fast-paced online games like first-person shooters. Players whose connections introduce even milliseconds of lag are put at a big disadvantage. Conversely, having your gaming PC or console hooked up to your Wi-Fi router with a cable can limit its placement options. Netgear has aimed to mitigate these issues by developing an operating system called DumaOS 3.0. This software, which runs on the XR1000, was designed specifically to address latency. It does so by automatically connecting to the fastest servers in your region and prioritizing internet bandwidth used by gaming hardware. Will it be perfect all of the time? No. But unless you\\u2019re playing online games competitively, you shouldn\\u2019t notice that much of a difference. The XR1000 is a single-point router, which means its signal won\\u2019t reach as far as a multi-router mesh Wi-Fi system. If the range is your biggest concern, look elsewhere. That said, this router\\u2019s monstrously high speeds and gaming-specific features make it a great get if that\\u2019s your primary use case. Best Wi-Fi 6: eero 6+ Range: 1,500 square feet Mesh: Yes (Potentially) Easy to set up and manage The potential to add more router later on Locks you into a specific hardware ecosystem Our experience with Eero\\u2019s higher-end hardware has been so positive that recommending its entry-level eero 6+ router was a no-brainer. The eero 6+ shares almost all of the same features as its higher-end sibling: an understated look, fast speeds, easy setup and maintenance, support for Eero Plus, in a smaller, single package. Eero offers the 6+ in a one-, two-, or three-pack to enable a mesh Wi-Fi setup, but we\\u2019re recommending a single router this time around because its 1,500-square-foot range makes it the perfect choice for many single-floor houses and apartments. The Eero 6+ isn\\u2019t quite as fast as the Pro 6E because it only supports Wi-Fi 6, but that won\\u2019t be an issue for everyday tasks like downloading files, casually playing games online, or streaming videos and music. We like that eero offers the ability to scale up your network over time, adding new routers as your needs change, or technology evolves. For example, you can get a single eero 6+ at a relatively low price today, then pick up a multi-router Pro 6E bundle down the line and add them to your existing network. This modularity puts eero\\u2019s 6+ at an advantage compared to a typical single-point router. If all you need is a single Wi-Fi 6-compatible router for your home, eero\\u2019s 6+ is the one to get. Best mesh: Linksys MX8503 Atlas Wi-Fi 6E Wi-Fi Mesh System Range: 9,000 square feet Broadcasts signal at three frequencies Prohibitively expensive In many ways, Linksys\\u2019 MX8503 Atlas Wi-Fi 6E Wi-Fi Mesh System is the best consumer-level wireless networking hardware available today. It has the highest top speeds, furthest range, most sophisticated wireless signal, and optimization features that ensure over 195 devices can be added to your network without suffering from wireless interference. The catch? The three-router system costs $800\\u2014on sale from its MSRP of $1000\\u2014which makes it a no-go for all but the most hardcore internet users with the fastest internet packages and greatest networking needs. If you\\u2019re one of those people, the MX8503 is peerless. Its top speed of 8.4Gbps will max out any internet package currently available in the United States and can handle the 5-Gigabit connections as they roll out in select markets over the next few years. Getting these Wi-Fi routers now will futureproof your network for the next decade\\u2014or however long Linksys supports this hardware\\u2014where speed is concerned. We\\u2019re also confident that this three-router system will be able to cover your entire home given its range of 9,000 square feet, though you can add more routers if you feel that it\\u2019s necessary. One of the reasons for the MX8503\\u2019s dominance is that it can connect to devices on three frequencies: 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz. Very few devices will be able to connect to the routers at 6Ghz, but the ones that do will enjoy the fastest speeds because there\\u2019ll be little to no interference. We\\u2019ve had the opportunity to test some of Linksys previous-generation networking hardware and found it pretty easy to set up and manage. The setup process is similar to eero\\u2019s, but we found the Linksys mobile app (iOS and Android) to be a little more cumbersome. Linksys\\u2019 MX8503 Atlas Wi-Fi 6E Wi-Fi Mesh System isn\\u2019t necessary for many homes, but small businesses that occupy a floor of an office building may find the high-speed potential and range appealing. If money is no object, and you want to live your tech life on the cutting edge, don\\u2019t hesitate to choose these Wi-Fi routers. Best long-range: TP-Link Deco X55 Range: 6,500 square feet Optimizes its performance based on your usage patterns Surprisingly reasonable price Slightly lower top speed If you have a multi-story home that needs a big internet upgrade, TP-Link\\u2019s Deco X55 is the best mesh router system for you. It covers 6,500 square feet, which is almost 10% more space than our best overall pick, from a three-pack of routers that costs less than half the price. Now the X55 is only Wi-Fi 6, which means its top speeds are lower than what\\u2019s on offer from eero and Linksys, but the value is still there. If you have an internet package that supports speeds of 500mbps or less, the difference in performance will be negligible\\u2014if any exists at all. It should be no surprise that the best Wi-Fi solution for long-range needs is a mesh router system. For the best performance, we recommend setting one of TP-Link\\u2019s routers on each floor of your home. TP-Link says the routers will learn your usage patterns\\u2014which devices in which areas demand the most bandwidth\\u2014and optimize itself to accommodate your needs. That means the game console in the basement that routinely downloads large files will get priority over a bedroom TV streaming YouTube videos in HD. Smart home gadgets should do all these tasks in the background, so we\\u2019re glad TP-Link has built this feature into its hardware. Our experience with older TP-Link link routers has always been positive, and we\\u2019ve been especially pleased with the company\\u2019s Deco app. TP-Link makes a whole host of smart home accessories, so it makes sense that it\\u2019s streamlined the setup process for internet-connected gear, but it\\u2019s still nice to see. If you\\u2019re totally new to mesh Wi-Fi routers, this is a good place to start. TP-Link says the X55 routers can automatically detect some security issues, but you can fortify your network with a paid HomeShield Pro account. The service, which costs $5.99 per month or $54.99 offers advanced parental controls, DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks, and advanced protection for smart home accessories. If you\\u2019re suffering from recurring network issues due to the size of your home, this set of TP-Link\\u2019s Deco X55 should fix them pretty easily. The range it offers at its price is also impressive, making it a particularly good value for those in larger spaces. Best portable: NETGEAR Nighthawk M1 LCD display shows key information Netgear\\u2019s Nighthawk M1 is a mobile hotspot, which means it can connect to a cellular satellite using a SIM card and create a unique Wi-Fi network. If you\\u2019re a frequent traveler, this battery-powered device is a must-have since you can access the internet from your phone, tablet, computer, or gaming device. Its 150Mbps speeds may not be impressive compared to the other Wi-Fi routers recommended, but none of those can run on battery power or fit into a backpack or pocket. One of the M1\\u2019s most impressive features is its Ethernet port, which allows you to use it in place of a cable modem and connect it to another Wi-Fi router. In this mode, the M1 would receive data from a cellular satellite and send that data through a Wi-Fi router, which would then communicate with all your devices. You could create a whole-home mesh Wi-Fi router system anywhere in the world with this setup\\u2014though that would require lugging several Wi-Fi routers in your luggage. The Nighthawk M1 is technically impressive, but it does have some limitations. It only works with AT&T and T-Mobile SIM cards, and the speeds you get will entirely rely on the strength of the 4G LTE cellular signal it receives. If you\\u2019re in an area with low bars, your Wi-Fi speeds will suffer. The good thing is that you\\u2019ll be able to see the quality of your network at a glance by looking at this router\\u2019s LED screen, which displays the strength of its cellular connection, battery life, how much time and data is left on your month\\u2019s internet plan, which network it\\u2019s connected to, and how many devices are connected to it. That\\u2019s a lot of information, but Netgear did a great job arranging it so that it\\u2019s easy to read and understand. If portability is your primary concern, and you want to take Wi-Fi with you everywhere, Netgear\\u2019s Nighthawk M1 is the right gadget for the job. Best budget: Vilo Mesh Wi-Fi System Range: 4,500 square feet Built-in parental controls Not Wi-Fi 6 compliant Let\\u2019s cut to the chase: Vilo is offering a three-router mesh Wi-Fi system for under $100 without making any serious compromises. That\\u2019s all you really need to know about this set of Wi-Fi routers, but it\\u2019s worth going into additional detail. Vilo\\u2019s routers support Wi-Fi 5 with speeds of up to 867Mbps and a range of 4,500 square feet. These specs are fine for common use cases like videoconferencing, downloading games, online shopping, and streaming movies. You can set up and manage these routers using an app and pick up additional ones to extend the range of your network down the line. We like that Vilo allows you to set per-device restrictions and time limits on specific devices, so you don\\u2019t have to constantly look over a child\\u2019s shoulder to ensure they\\u2019re not looking at anything objectionable or wonder if they\\u2019re secretly on their phone after bedtime. The lack of Wi-Fi 6 support and lower speeds that come along with that will matter if you pay for a gigabit internet plan, but it\\u2019s a non-issue if you\\u2019re on a package that\\u2019s 300Mbps or less. You can eke out more performance from devices with an Ethernet jack by connecting them to one of Vilo\\u2019s routers directly. The difference in speed won\\u2019t be too big, but you may end up with a slightly more consistent connection. All mesh Wi-Fi router systems used to cost several hundred dollars, and while the price of this networking gear has come down some recently, the value of Vilo\\u2019s Wi-Fi routers can\\u2019t be overstated. If you have a fairly large home and don\\u2019t need the fastest possible speeds for work or play, you can\\u2019t go wrong here. What to consider when buying the best Wi-Fi routers Below are the features we considered most important when determining the best Wi-Fi routers to select for this guide: It\\u2019s hard to argue against speed being the most important factor in choosing a Wi-Fi router because it\\u2019s the likeliest reason you\\u2019re upgrading from the one you have. There are a couple of steps we recommend taking before picking up new hardware to determine whether or not it\\u2019s worth the investment. First, see whether the speeds you\\u2019re getting from your current setup match up with the plan you\\u2019re paying for from your ISP. If all of the internet packages in your area are slow, getting a new Wi-Fi router isn\\u2019t going to make much of an improvement in this area. If you\\u2019re getting speeds far slower than what you\\u2019re paying for, and you\\u2019re using a standalone Wi-Fi router connected to your ISP-supplied modem, consider picking up an Ethernet cable that supports gigabit speeds. This cable will set you back less than $10, and may fix your issue. Finally, contact your ISP to see if there\\u2019s an issue on their end or if the hardware they supplied you is faulty. ISPs can reset your cable modem remotely, resolving a surprising amount of internet issues. If you\\u2019ve followed these steps and still determined you want or need a new Wi-Fi router, make sure to choose one that supports a slightly higher speed than what you\\u2019re paying for. For example, if you\\u2019re paying for an internet connection that supports download speeds up to 100Mbps (megabits per second), pick a router that supports speeds up to 500Mbps. You\\u2019ll always lose some bandwidth between your Wi-Fi router and device\\u2014especially if there\\u2019s a wall in the way\\u2014so it\\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. Most modern Wi-Fi routers have maximum speeds that are several times higher than what an ISP can deliver, but it\\u2019s something to consider. If you\\u2019re looking to expand the size of your network, the first Wi-Fi router spec to look at is its range. For the best results, look at the size of your home and get a router that\\u2019s rated to cover an area that\\u2019s slightly larger to account for Wi-Fi signals getting weaker as they go through walls. If you have a smaller home, you may only need a single-point router, which, as its name suggests, sends Wi-Fi signals out from one place. Single-point routers typically have multiple antennas, which can be arranged in different directions to help encourage even coverage. If upgrading from a modem/router combo provided by your ISP, you have experience with a single-point router. We recommend getting a mesh Wi-Fi router system if you have a large home, dense walls, a lot of internet-connected devices, or any combination of the three. Mesh Wi-Fi systems rely on multiple routers placed in different parts of your home to create a giant network. Devices will automatically connect to the router closest to them, and you\\u2019re guaranteed to get better overall coverage with this type of system. The downside is that you\\u2019ll need to dedicate multiple outlets in different parts of your home to networking hardware. Nothing is more important than internet security, so choosing routers that support the latest encryption technologies was paramount. The routers we recommend support the third-generation Wi-Fi Protection Alliance standard, shortened to WPA3. This disallows outside interlopers from easily hacking into your network through security holes. That said, the best first line of defense against network hacking is a strong password. Your ISP-supplied modem/router combo will come with a network name and password, but it\\u2019s up to you to create a good one when you\\u2019re setting up your own hardware. You\\u2019ll see this tech spec a lot, but it\\u2019s less important than you may think. Basically, versions of Wi-Fi used to be classified by the number 802.11 followed by a series of letters. This became confusing because the letters didn\\u2019t follow a set pattern: For instance, 802.11N was worse than 802.11AC, which was worse than 802.11AX. The Wi-Fi Alliance moved to a numbered versioning system to help consumers distinguish between different models but has since muddied the waters a little bit. The current Wi-Fi standard is Wi-Fi 6E (the E stands for enhanced), while Wi-Fi 7 hardware was announced at CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in 2023. We\\u2019re only recommending Wi-Fi routers that support Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E for simplicity. One important note is that Wi-Fi is a backward-compatible tech standard, which means your Wi-Fi-enabled devices don\\u2019t need to support the same Wi-Fi version as your router. If you buy a router that\\u2019s Wi-Fi 6E compliant but have gadgets that were made 10 years ago, you\\u2019ll have no problem connecting them to the internet. On the other hand, you\\u2019ll reap the full speed and connectivity benefits of your Wi-Fi router when you upgrade to newer hardware. Most modern Wi-Fi routers have two bands, which means they send a signal at two frequencies: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Older dual-band routers will actually create two separate Wi-Fi networks (typically shown as \\u201cNetwork Name\\u201d and \\u201cNetwork Name 5G\\u201d). In contrast, newer ones automatically connect to your device at the correct frequency. The benefit of sending a signal out at multiple frequencies is to reduce wireless interference. Many wireless technologies\\u2014wireless landline phones specifically\\u2014would use the same spectrum, which could reduce the effectiveness of your Wi-Fi router. Some routers have three bands, with the third reinforcing the 5 GHz spectrum. The main purpose of a Wi-Fi router is the create (or extend) your home\\u2019s wireless network, but many of them also have Ethernet ports, which allow you to use them as a wired networking switch. The truth is that a wired internet connection will always be faster and more consistent than a wireless one\\u2014though the gap has closed significantly and is basically imperceptible in most cases. Q: What does a Wi-Fi router do? A Wi-Fi router receives an internet connection from your cable modem and sends out a wireless signal, which your devices can receive and use to access the internet. A Wi-Fi router can also be used as a wired networking switch simultaneously. Q: Will a better router increase internet speed? This depends. Your Wi-Fi router will not get you faster speeds than the package you\\u2019re paying for allows you. However, it may allow you to get the top speeds you\\u2019re paying for more effectively than your current networking equipment. Q: How much should I spend on a router? This depends on the features you want, but you shouldn\\u2019t have to spend more than $100 on a Wi-Fi router. Q: Should I consider a mesh router? If you need to cover a large space with a wireless network, we recommend considering a mesh Wi-Fi system consisting of two or more routers. If you have a small space, a single-point router may be sufficient.
