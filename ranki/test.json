            "product_description": "Listen in silence Silence means better sound. That’s why the Bose QuietComfort Wireless Bluetooth Noise-Cancelling Earphones block out distracting background sounds and lets you focus on what’s playing. You can choose just how much you want to block out too. Let in ambient sounds while you’re walking down a busy street or eliminate all distractions for pure focus while you’re working. Switch to full transparency mode to have conversations without removing your earbuds. Bose lifelike sound These small buds produce big sound. The EQ is automatically balanced for you, so you’ll appreciate the lows and highs of your favourite songs at any volume. Paired with the silence of noise-cancelling, you’ll hear all kinds of details in your music that typically get lost, such every note strummed on an acoustic guitar. Practical design Rated IPX4 for water resistance, these earbuds will see you through casual workouts – and you don’t have to worry if you get caught in the rain. Touch controls make it easy to control your music and answer calls. Phone calls are loud and clear thanks to mics that separate your voice from background noise. You can setup your shortcuts – along with naming your buds, customising the noise-cancelling, checking your battery, choosing your voice assistant, and more – with the free Bose Music app. Handy charging case The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds provide up to 6 hours of battery life between charges. Simply pop them in the charging case between listens for an additional 12 hours of battery life. When you’re in a rush, just 15 minutes of charging will give you up to 2 hours of playback time.",

From cushion to canopy, AirPods Max are designed for an uncompromising fit that creates the optimal acoustic seal for many different head shapes - fully immersing you in every sound. The canopy spanning the headband is made from a breathable knit mesh, distributing weight to reduce on-head pressure. The stainless steel frame is wrapped with a soft-to-the-touch material for a remarkable combination of strength, flexibility, and comfort. Telescoping arms smoothly extend and stay where you set them, for a consistent fit and seal. The beautifully anodized aluminum cups feature a revolutionary mechanism that allows each cup to rotate independently and balance pressure. A custom-designed mesh textile wraps the ear cushions to provide pillow-like softness while listening. Crafted with acoustically engineered memory foam, the ear cushions gently create an immersive seal that is the foundation of incredible sound. The Digital Crown lets you precisely control volume, skip between tracks, answer phone calls, and activate Siri.",

I switched to these recently after using and absolutely loving the QuietComfort 20 wired earbuds for many years. The comfort, fit audio, ANC and everything else about the QC20s were top notch. The Stayhear tips on the QC20s fit my ears so perfectly, that I figured these would be the same, just in wireless form. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The in-ear fit with these earbuds is slightly bulkier than the QC20s, and don't quite sit fully into the ear canal for me like the QC20s did. The touch features on the earbuds are nice, but I ended up turning off touch controls because I would activate the controls just trying to get these earbuds to fit securely in my ear every ... ",

There are 10 levels of noise cancellation, and you can define two custom presets to easily toggle between your favorite levels. This is in addition to two built-in levels, which are \"quiet\" (the max setting) and \"aware\" (the min setting). With cancellation at max, and some light music playing, the world completely drowns away. This exceeds the noise cancellation ability of my older, wired, Bose noise cancellation earbuds, which is impressive since these are wireless. The \"aware\" mode can be configured so that it auto adjusts the cancellation level based on ambient noise. I use this while push mowing my yard. When the mower is off, the cancellation is off, and I ... ",

So when I wanted to update to wireless earbuds, I figured I’d go with Bose again because of their outstanding quality and reliability. Sadly, my confidence in Bose has been severely shaken after purchasing these Quiet Comfort earbuds. Now, when they work they are pretty solid. I thought the sound was great, the noise cancelling worked well and the fit was fairly comfortable. Unfortunately, less than a week after purchasing them the left earbud went dead while I was on vacation and wouldn’t charge. I tried all of the trouble shooting tips, but nothing would work. So I finished my vacation with one earbud (which was a pain) and decided I would would ... ",

The good I can say of this product is that the noise cancelling is impressive. I work online, and I consistently have clients who cannot hear me well with this product, but can hear me perfectly on cheap sets (non bose headphones). Furthermore, there is a buzz in the headphones, that also existed in the previous set (as I had one set returned). I would not suggest this for phone calls. I also purchased these for working in the shop... anytime there is a sudden sound (saw blade, etc) there is a strong noise the headphones create (which I assume is it trying to balance the outside sound) but it is more piercing then the shop ... ",

Touch controls - cool concept but needs to be taken a step further. It's great having the ability to assign one short cut but that's not enough to offset the loss of the physical buttons from lower end models from Bose.

This is a nuisance. You can connect them to a device that doesn't have this app, but you can't then check the state of noise cancellation. Once you have a good feel for the noise cancellation state, you can change it by tapping the left bud.

The positives however are that the connection is much easier to manage, the Sony's used to be a pain to get to sync to multiple devices, the AirPods Max are much better in that regard. I'm sure that's mostly the H1 chip and using Apple devices but it's so much more pleasant not to fight Bluetooth to get them to connect.

we're going to be testing these top six noise cancelling headphones to figure out which of these is the best on the market and which of these i am going to buy for myself now the cool thing is we actually have a whole range of these in different price points we have the ridiculously cheap anchor sound cores we have the microsoft surface headphone 2. we have the sony wh xm 1000 m4 or something like that we have the bose qc700s we have the apple airport max and we have the stupidly expensive b and o b o plate h95 and so for each of these what we did is that i tested them extensively myself and we got a few team members to test them all as well and we're going to rate them all in terms of aesthetics in terms of fit and comfort in terms of noise cancellation and in terms of sound quality for music now as you know i'm a fan of upfront conclusions so i'm just going to come out and say that the ones i'll be getting are the sony wh mx4s whatever they're called if you're on a budget the anker sound cores are actually surprisingly reasonable and if you don't care about long-term comfort and are happy to spend a bit more money the apple airpods maxes are the choice for you so if that's all you wanted from the video then thank you very much for watching and do please have a great rest of day but now we're going to go over these one at a time and i'm going to share the pros and the cons of each of these six pairs of headphones and i'll show the results of my personal and our team testing about the various factors so that whichever one of these you're buying you can make hopefully a slightly more informed decision about the noise canceling headphones that are obviously going to change your life so we're going to start with the cheapest ones and these are the anker soundcore q30s which retail for about 100 and if you're on a budget these are actually a really good option and probably the best value for money that you can get in terms of the noise cancellation headphone wireless headphone market their design is a little bit plasticky and flimsy and they come with this sound core case thing which again is nothing to write home about it's got these little cheapy cheap looking pieces of foam in it as well but to be honest for the price it's not bad at all in terms of fit and comfort it's actually pretty reasonable in terms of looks these did get the lowest rating from our team members and from me with most of us rating it either a one or two for an average rating of 1.5 stars in terms of looks but in terms of fit and comfort they're actually pretty reasonable and most of us rated them a four or three so this got a rating of 3.5 in terms of fit and comfort now when it comes to noise cancellation i'm gonna be honest like i tested these fairly extensively and i didn't really notice much of a difference between the noise cancelling capabilities of the different headphones in fairness we are in this fairly quiet environment if i was in an airplane or on a train or in the london underground maybe the noise cancelling test would have been better but as far as i could really tell they were all fairly similar in terms of noise cancelling ability but in terms of sound quality there were some noticeable differences between the six headphones in the lineup the sound is pretty good but i'm not like wowed by it i'm still getting that kind of like cheap feel and these ones clocked in fairly reasonably with an average rating of 3.75 stars across our team the battery life on these is absolutely incredible it's 40 hours apparently with noise cancelling and 60 hours if you turn off the noise cancelling and they've got a few buttons on the bottom where you can increase the volume or decrease the volume or hit play and pause again these are nothing to write home about but if for example you're a student and you're on a budget and you do want a pair of noise cancelling headphones to make it easier to focus when you're working or if you're in a coffee shop or whatever then these are by far the best value for money and they also fall down nicely and can go kind of go into this case and you can shove this little piece of plastic in there somewhere if you really want to but yeah fairly reasonable option if you are on a budget moving up a little bit in terms of price point we now have the microsoft surface headphones too which retail for around about 270 dollars now in terms of aesthetics i actually quite like these especially because they're this sort of silvery whitey kind of color and i'm a fan of things that look white broadly and they have these interesting features in that on both knobs you can like turn the knobs so one of the knobs is full volume and the other knob is for the noise cancellation ability of the headphones allegedly they have multi-device support and so they can connect to two devices at once and allegedly it can switch between your iphone and your macbook if it recognizes you're getting a phone call in practice this feature does not work like it has never once actually worked as intended for me and in terms of battery life it's fairly low it's got around about 18 hours of battery life which means you do have to charge it somewhat regularly if you're going to be using it extensively for long work sessions in terms of aesthetics i gave this a five star rating but some of the team gave it a three and four star so the average rating of this was four stars and in terms of fit and comfort it's actually very reasonable i've got fives and fours across the board with an average rating of 4.3 stars but sadly in terms of sound quality these are just not as good as some of the alternatives so i gave this personally a three out of five in terms of sound quality which was kind of what the team thought as well so this had an average rating of 3.3 stars in terms of music quality so i actually used to use these for about six months in 2021 and i really liked them mostly because of the aesthetic they were quite nice to be honest i hadn't a b tested them with a bunch of different headphones to be honest all these review videos are somewhat artificial because once you have one of these headphones it doesn't really matter which one you have you kind of then just get used to it and that becomes the new normal it's only when you really compare them side by side with like kind of six other headphones that you start to quibble about things like noise quality but broadly i was a big fan of them um when i had them and i like the fact that they came with this nice little case which meant i could just chuck it in my bag and the case had a nice little slot for the cables as well then sadly my tesla got broken into and these got stolen so this is just a pair that we ordered for review purposes but after testing them side by side with all the others i've decided that i'm no longer going to be using the microsoft surface headphones too because the sonys are just a little bit better than them across all fronts except the aesthetics anyway that brings us on to the sony what are they called the sony wh-1000xm4s this is the only real problem with these is that it's impossible to remember what the name is sony really needs to come up with a better way of naming these headphones but they are the ones that i'm going to be now switching to because i think they're the perfect mix of comfort and sound quality and noise cancellation and battery life even if the aesthetic is just slightly less nice than the microsoft surface headphones too now in terms of fit and comfort these actually were the best headphones that we tested they were the most comfortable buy a reasonable margin decent very comfortable most comfortable yet and i think the main reason for that is that these are just so light they are i think probably the lightest out of the six headphones that we've tested although i haven't measured it just on my head they feel really light and when it comes to wearing these for extended periods of time really the comfort correlates strongly with how heavy the headphones are or rather how light the headphones are because the main problem with the airpods max for example like they're amazing in sound quality they're amazing in battery life they're amazing across all fronts it's just that they're really heavy and after like an hour of using them my head starts to hurt from having such heavy headphones on it and so the fact that the sony's are so comfortable to wear for very extended periods of time i think it's mostly down to just how light they are in terms of looks yeah they're not bad the team thought they were five stars and four stars in terms of looks i'd personally rate them a three star because i do prefer the look of the microsoft surface headphones but i mean they're very reasonable they look like just a normal pair of noise cancelling headphones nothing to write home about and in terms of design they fold up nicely like this so it's very easy to pack into a bag and they also come with this little carry case that if you want you can put them in i'm probably not going to do that because that's too much faff i'm just probably going to stick them in my bag exactly like that they charge like all these do by usbc that's pretty standard and unsurprisingly they've got a power button and a button that lets you control the level of noise cancellation in terms of battery life these are actually really good they're advertised as having 30 hours of battery life with the noise cancellation and 38 hours without noise cancellation if you're not into noise cancellation for whatever reason and in terms of sound quality for listening to music i personally thought these were really good i gave them a four star rating sadly this was not mirrored by our team who thought they were more like two stars and three stars in terms of noise quality and so the overall rating for this in terms of sound quality is 3.5 stars but personally i think that's a little bit of an under estimate of what's the actual i say actual my my personal subjective interpretation of their their music quality was and to be honest this sort of subjectiveness you get a lot when it comes to testing headphones like i'm not an audiophile no one in our team is really an audiophile and so we don't objectively know what these headphones sound like all we can say is what our subjective experience like oh this sounds a bit better than that and after doing a bunch of hot swapping to be like are these really sounding better than the surface are these really sounding better than the boses i kind of decided at the end that like yeah whenever i put these on my head i felt ah these are so comfortable and i also felt that oh the sound quality on these is pretty good yeah not as good as the airpods max airplanes backs max wins across the board just blew everyone else out of the water in terms of sound quality but i don't think that trade-off is warranted given how heavy they are and therefore how uncomfortable they are for long periods of time at least for me and so the sony's are the ones that i'm going to be holding on to i haven't figured out whether i want them in white or silver or in blue i'm not too much of a fan of this matte black color but hey they're really good and these are now going to be a staple part of my everyday carry all right now we're spending a little bit more money and we come to the bose qc 700s which retail for 350 but these are a little bit more expensive than the sony's and actually i think the main selling point is the look it does look quite nice um our team was a bit uh split on whether we liked this particular style with these like yeah it's just a slightly different design to most noise cancelling headphones i personally quite like them but in terms of comfort they're not quite as good as the sony's and in terms of sound quality for me also they're not quite as good as the sony's our team rated these pretty poorly across the board so this got an average of 3.25 stars when it came to fit and comfort it got a three stars in terms of noise cancellation and it got a 3.1 stars in terms of sound quality and a 3.2 stars in terms of look so like broadly if we averaged the four four five four four team members that we had testing these broadly we weren't a fan these are actually the ones i've been using for the last six months since my tesla got broken into and i lost my microsoft surface headphones too i've actually been using these but i'm going to give them away to a friend and instead replace them with the sony's because the sony's are marginally better in terms of comfort and in terms of sound quality next we come to the apple airpod maxes which are really expensive and retail for around about 640 dollars at least if you convert the pounds we'll put the actual dollar price over here now these come with the case but we have two team members gordon angus in our studio who use these and they never carry the case with them similarly when i used to use the apple airpods max i never carry the case because the case is totally pointless and genuinely these are really good the sound quality is just way better than all of the other headphones that we tested and when you put these on you immediately think oh my god this sounds incredible compared to the other noise cancelling headphones and anyway it kind of screws up your mind a bit or your ear rather because it makes you think that the others sound bad in comparison to this but then after a while of getting used to the others you stop you you kind of forget what it was like to wear the apple airpods max this is probably the best sounding of them all the sound is amazing the design is a bit polarizing i quite like the blue color personally rather than the black and they've got this little mesh thing at the top which is kind of comfortable but the main thing the main drawback of these as i've said is that they're just too heavy they're very comfortable for short amounts of time but for more than about half an hour i started to find my kind of ears getting a bit tired my head getting a bit tired maybe i'm not hench enough to handle these but i just i just really wasn't a fan in terms of long-term comfort levels now if you have apple devices these are actually really good because there is a chip or something inside them that makes them pair with iphones and macs really easily so you can literally just wear them and they will automatically pair to your iphone or to your mac and really that means that there isn't actually a way of turning them off the way they go into standby mode is when you put them in the case but given that realistically no one really carries the case around because it's kind of useless it does have that slight quirk to them it's got a little button at the top which acts as a little sort of volume dial and also if you press the button down you can access siri but the issue is that these are the only phones that don't have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack so if you listen to stuff on airplanes a lot and you want to plug your headphones into the aeroplane system thingy so that you can watch a movie on the aeroplane using your fancy noise canceling headphones you can do that with all the others but you can't do it with the apple airpods max this is not a huge problem like to be honest these were the clear winners in most of the categories in terms of comfort so yeah great pair of headphones super expensive but you do get fantastic sound quality for that but they are not for me because i just can't handle them in terms of the heaviness and the discomfort and finally we come to the big daddies the b o b o play h95s which are ridiculously expensive these come in at 940 or thereabouts and they have they have these like leather thingies around them i think you can actually take these off yeah you can take them off they have leather around them they have this leather thing at the top so it's like a more premium higher end feel to these noise canceling headphones but sadly they are just not very good in terms of the aesthetics our team was a bit split on them i quite like these metal bits and i would have even liked the nordic ice color because these come in a multitude of colors and that color looks really cool but again they run into into the same issue that the airpods max do in that they are quite heavy and so wearing them for extended periods of time can actually get a little bit uncomfortable sound quality as well again it's reasonable most of our team rated them somewhere between three and four stars i would just thought that the sound would be better for this price so the sound quality doesn't feel amazing i thought these were a three star personally i did personally prefer the sound quality of the sony's despite the fact that these are like triple the price but i guess what you're really paying for here is the sort of more premium leather feel of the noise cancelling headphones and to be honest i liked the nordic ice color at least on the website so much that if these were slightly lighter i probably would have gone for these just to have the flecks of like having a really nicely aesthetic pair of headphones sadly they're not comfortable enough to even warrant that so basically i'm not a fan of these despite them being quite expensive and quite high-end oh the other cool thing about them is that they do come in this fancy like metal case thing which feels feels very high-end feels very premium makes you think feel healed oh sick but it's also a case that's quite heavy by itself and so it's not a case that you're really going to be carrying in a backpack it's more for the kind of aesthetics of the unboxing experience and so that you can feel oh i'm a legend because i wear bang olufsen noise canceling headphones now in terms of practical uses of these noise canceling headphones there's three main domains that have made up the bulk of my use of these over the last few years firstly it's listening to my study with me playlist on spotify while i'm trying to work or focus or do any kind of deep work at all second it's consuming things like music and podcast and audiobooks while i'm on things like trains and airplanes because the noise canceling is really helpful and thirdly i find these noise canceling headphones really helpful if i'm editing videos because then with the noise cancelling i can edit videos wherever i go and speaking of editing videos another tool that i find incredibly helpful is called storyblocks who are very kindly sponsoring this video i've been using storyblocks since i started this youtube channel five years ago in 2017. droidblocks is absolutely fantastic it is a subscription service that gives you royalty-free stock photos and stock videos and stock music that you can use in youtube videos just like this one in fact when we got team members to test out the headphones some of the tracks we were using were from storyblocks royalty free so that we can include them in this video without getting copyright stricken for them me and our editors personally find storyblocks super helpful when we're trying to find b-roll and especially in the early days of this youtube channel when i was trying to juggle making videos with the demands of being a medical student and later the demands of being a doctor it was super helpful to have this library of high quality stock footage available to use as b-roll so that i didn't necessarily have to go out and spend hours and hours shooting my own b-roll for all the videos that i was making and other than just videos and music storyblocks also has things like after effect templates and premiere pro templates for titles lower thirds transitions and even sound effects that you can incorporate into your videos whenever you want storyblocks has subscriptions for any budget and so if you want to check it out then do hit the link in the video description so thank you so much storyblocks for sponsoring this video and for helping out the channel over the last five years so overall when it comes to these headphones the budget pick is the anker sound cores which are very reasonable my personal pick is the sony wh mx1000 xm4s or whatever they're called and if you don't care about the comfort thing the airpods maxes are by far the best ones in terms of sound quality if you like this video you might be interested in what sort of podcasts i listen to with my fancy pair of noise cancelling headphones and that'll be in a video over there called 20 podcasts that made me millionaire so thank you so much for watching and i'll see you in the next video bye ",
        "n-6qk7EGLlE": "while true wireless earbuds have dominated the headphones landscape the last few years there are plenty of people who still like the full size variety and that's why I put together this Roundup of the best wireless noise canceling over-ear headphones of 2022. that'll be clear these are headphones that were released in 2022 and I haven't included any models that came out in years past I've narrowed it down to my five favorites with an additional affordable pick thrown in because when you get into these top wireless headphones well they tend to be rather expensive and a lot of people just can't afford them but we're talking about the best of the best so here we go here are my picks from highest to lowest price [Music] at 799 we have the focal bathies focal is a French Audio company known for its high-end speakers and wired headphones some of which cost thousands of dollars it's finally done with a lot of high-end audio companies have had to do in this age of on-the-go Wireless music listening make active noise canceling Bluetooth headphones but they also have a built-in DAC that stands for digital to analog converter for USB wirelessening with any computer smartphone or tablet with USBC and that makes it easy to go from Wireless to wirelessening for slightly better sound the bathys build quality and design are excellent they're comfortable to wear and they're easily one of the best sounding wireless headphones they offer excellent Clarity detail accuracy and Powerful well-defined bass that's got the right amount of warp to it they have a spacious Sound Stage for closed back headphones anyway and they allow you to hear each instrument distinctly in complicated tracks where several instruments are playing at the same time the bathies use aluminum magnesium speaker drivers while focals higher end wired headphones have beryllium drivers that offer even more clarity and accuracy with the right setup their noise canceling isn't as strong or as good as what you get with the Sony wh-1000 Xbox 5 or the Bose quiet Comfort 45 headphones for example but focal has done its best to implement noise canceling without sacrificing sound quality which is always a challenge they're also good for making calls so a really great headphone overall but out of most people's price range though it is cheaper than the mark Levinson number 5909 headphones that go for around a thousand bucks okay moving on to the Bowers and Wilkins px8 at 699 when they originally announced the Swanky px8 were supposed to cost 549 for essentially the same price as Apple's airpods max headphones however when they finally hit stores the px8s price jumped to 6.99 or a full 300 more than the company stepped down px7 Series 2 headphones which are also excellent the biggest difference between the px8 and the px7 S2 are the px8s all new 40 millimeter carbon cone drive units that are inspired by the carbon Dome drive units used in the company's 700 series loudspeaker line Bowers and Wilkins says these units help deliver Superior resolution detail and timing with even more accurate sound than the px7s II based on my test that's true I like the px7s2 the px8 headphones do sound more special with the touch more openness and overall Clarity the right near the top for sound in a Bluetooth headphone and are also comfortable to wear for long listening sessions for the best sound you can listen to lossless files on a computer in wired mode with a USBC to USBC cable as for the noise canceling function it's good but not quite on par with what you get with the Sony wh-1000x Mark V and while the voice calling capabilities are solid these don't reduce background noise quite as well as some headphones like the Sony when you're on calls however the transparency mode is Top Notch while I can't say they're worth 300 more than the px7 S2 they're a great set of cans if you can afford them I do prefer the sound and overall performance with a more expensive focal bathies that the bathies don't have such strong noise canceling but the px8 are a close second at 5.99 we have the master of dynamic mw75 headphones the company's best headphones to date a last metal construction adds weight but that's a trade-off some people don't mind the mw75 sound excellent with clean accurate sound natural sounding mids and nice treble detail the base is tight and Punchy with just enough warmth the mw75 seem well suited for all types of music genres and I had no trouble wearing the headphones for longer listening sessions though I would have liked the ear pads to be slightly larger I thought they measured up well against the Apple airpods Max for sound quality the mw75 came across as the more accurate natural sounding headphones the airpods max had a little more energy and played a little louder but the mw75 sounded a bit smoother and a tad more articulate it's also worth noting that while the mw75 don't have quite the noise canceling capabilities of the Sony wh-1000x Mark V they do offer very good noise canceling and are also very good for making calls another great headphone overall speaking of the Sony that's the next headphone on this list it's 400 though it's been discounted lately to around 350 this is the headphone that's going to hit the sweet spot for a lot of people it's relatively lightweight and comfortable sounds really good and offers top-notch noise canceling and noise reduction during voice calls Some people prefer the dual hinge design at the earlier 1000x mark IV which offers a little more bass energy but I personally prefer the slightly more refined sound of the Mark V and particularly appreciated the improvements to the call Quality well the Sony doesn't sound quite as good as the models I've already talked about it does have some nice extra features like Sony speak to chat mode and it does cost less and has Best in Class noise canceling at number five I have sennheiser's momentum for wireless a 350 headphone that's been selling for closer to 300 while some people may be a little disappointed that their design has become a bit too straightforward and less distinctive with less premium materials than the previous momentum three they essentially check all the boxes for what you want in a premium noise canceling headphone from the standpoint of comfort features and performance initially I wasn't wowed by them but after I broke them in for a few days their sound grew on me and Sennheiser has improved not only their noise canceling performance but also their voice calling performance and unlike the previous momentum 3 they do fold flat and have incredible battery life at up to 60 hours depending on what I was listening to there were times when I thought they did sound slightly better than the Sony's they're just a tad more natural and accurate sounding and they do cost less than the Sony so that's another reason to consider them last but not least I have my value pick the sound core by anchor space Q45 which is currently selling for around 130 if you can afford Sony's 1000x Mark V or the similarly named Bose qc45 yes there's a bit of copying going on here the space Q45 is a good alternative it's comfortable to wear with nicely padded ear cups and a dual hinge folding design sound quality is very good and the headphones offer better noise canceling than the step down Q35 as well as multi-point Bluetooth pairing and they do support the ldac audio codec for streaming high resolution music tracks over Bluetooth if you have a device that supports ldac many Android phones do although Samsung's Galaxy phones don't battery life is also very good at up to 50 hours with noise canceling on to be clear this headphone isn't up to level of the other headphones in this Roundup but it's Anchor's best sounding noise canceling headphone to date and a good value relatively speaking so that's it those are my top over ear wireless headphones of 2022 if you want more info about any of these products we've got links to all of them in the description below along with any full reviews I've done on CNET if you've got a favorite headphone yourself feel

        "W0tGO9RIjjg": "thank you welcome to the ovary headphones Awards where for the past few months I've been doing some in-depth testing on as many different pairs as I could to narrow down a list of the best wireless headphones you can buy of course everyone has different priorities when it comes to headphones and the term best can vary depending on what you want from your headphones for some that's the noise canceling performance for others is the call Quality or comfort and for many it's simply the sound quality so I tested each of them against each other in a series of tests to determine the winners in each of these categories before finally narrowing down a top seven so as we go through the video I'll give you a review of each of these headphones highlighting the areas they perform well and not so well in I'll show you the final rankings at the end so we can see the winners in each category and from this we can determine the overall performance of each one which will not only give us our ultimate winner but should also help you to see which of these headphones best suits your particular needs there's obviously a lot to cover here and it's taken weeks of testing to get to this point so without further Ado let's take a look at the headphones awards for 2023 we'll start things off with the new Bose quiet Comfort SE which is essentially exactly the same as the qc45s the only differences are a sled color change and a redesigned carry case this is actually the only soft carry case in this video the essay even appears as the 45s when you connect to the app just in case there was any doubt that the two models are the same interestingly Bose confirmed to me that the SC isn't a replacement for the 45s and is to launch alongside them instead confusingly at a lower price point right now for those wondering about the Bose nc700 they were a contender but with the SE having Superior battery life noise canceling sound quality and comfort these were the better choice with the SE the build quality and basic design aren't as premium or aesthetically pleasing as some of her other entries the button controls are a little mushy and bunch closely together there's no wearing detection and these use the less common two and a half millimeter port for the aux cable but the clue isn't the name as to why these make this list Bose's quiet Comfort headphones are both fantastic and noise canceling and super comfortable to wear for long periods of time these are the lightest pair of headphones in this entire video and pairing this with spacious earcups and an ultra low clamping Force these are one of the best pairs you can buy for long listening sessions with this design the relatively thin headband and ear cup padding is actually plenty and has the added benefit of not causing your ears to warm up too much but surprisingly these take second place for comfort and we'll see which entry beats these later so that's the Comfort aspect and as for the quiet part well these have amazing noise canceling performance and beat all of the other competitors for ANC simply put these are the strongest noise canceling headphones you can buy right now so with a foldable design in excellent Comfort these are one of the best options you can get for traveling especially long-haul flights so that alone is enough to make lots of people buy these but let's take a look at where these didn't perform so well firstly the my quality was one of the poorest here he's letting quite a lot of the background noise and my voice wasn't especially clear those do have the useful self-voice feature so you can adjust how much of your own voice you want to hear on a call it's in a noisy environment these headphones struggle to isolate your voice 's companion app is super clean but also fairly limited for instance despite being the most powerful you can't adjust the level of noise cancellation incidentally customization was the main area I found the nc700 to be better but here it's either full ANC or in transparency mode which by the way isn't anywhere near as good as the ANC possibly as a result of not being able to switch these to off mode the battery life is the poorest in this video at just 24 hours there's also no Google Fast pair or high-end codecs it's SBC or AAC only but like every entry in this video These do offer multi-points so you can connect to two devices at the same time and switch over by pausing on one and playing on the other with the sound quality this was one of the easier aspects to rank because although the sound quality is good here these are a noticeable step down in quality compared to the others Bose has quite a unique sound signature where the mids and vocals are pushed forward and the bass is quite tame it's a tuning that could be great for podcasts and is unlikely to fatigue your ears but the clarity and instrument separation is lacking and increasing the volume to compensate for the lack of bass the high-end frequencies can become harsh Bose's basic equalizer only lets you offset this slightly and I think overall with the lack of any high-end codecs these are one of the weaker performers when it comes to sound quality casual listeners will find these okay but audio files should stay clear so that fantastic noise cancellation and comfort does come with some trade-offs but the price is not one of them because these are the cheapest entry in this video the new SE model aren't quite appearing on the US Bose site yet but the 45s are down to 249 and I've even seen this as low as 189 pounds in the UK okay the next entry is the master and dynamic mw75 this time we get a rather large hard shell carry case covered in felds which isn't my favorite design but does keep the headphones protected these are packed with accessories including nylon braided USB C2C and USB to three and a half millimeter cables a quarter inch adapter a USBC to a adapter and an airplane adapter all neatly stored inside the case immediately you notice the big step up in terms of build quality and design these are one of the three what I'd call Luxury models in this video they're made of anodized aluminum glass and lambskin leather so they're no good if you're avoiding animal products but the materials contribute to an undeniably premium aesthetic the overall construction feels really solid it's just a shame these don't fall down for easier transport button controls are tactile but a bit on the small side and again bunch too close together you can easily power these off by mistake when reaching for the ANC button we do at least have wearing detection here though it was a bit inconsistent with these they won't Auto resume if you leave them paused for any more than a few seconds interestingly the usb-c port serves as both the charging port and the connection for Wired listening there's no AUX port on the headphones at all the trade-off with this premium materials is weights and therefore Comforts these are the heaviest headphones in this list at 338 grams and you really feel it the clamping force is reasonable but I find the ear cups are too small you have to maneuver these back and forth until your rears finally fit inside and there's not much room to breathe either the relatively firm but thick padding does help and I can still comfortably wear these for a few hours but they're placed in seventh for Comfort overall the 75s don't boast much in terms of features the app is rather basic hosting a handful of preset equalizers but disappointingly no custom EQ toggles for the audio prompt wearing detection feature and the auto power off and some options for the ANC mode but that's essentially it so it's not an app you really need to revisit in terms of the actual noise canceling performance these are just about on the right side of average the same as with the transparency mode and the rankings reflect this too ANC suddenly helps in a noisy environment but these don't perform to the level one might hope the headphones or the price tag this large attached plus these come with a quiet hiss with ANC turned on you at least get some more options here such as adaptive mode and you can turn off ANC to save on battery too you get 28 hours of listening with ANC so that's just above bows and puts these in sixth place one surprisingly good aspect is the cool quality these do a really decent job even in noisy environments and isolate my voice well on phone calls good enough to award these third plays for the microphone quality there's no Google Fast pair again but we do have much better codec choices with support for aptx adaptive which of course means higher quality streaming too these also offer multi-points and Bluetooth 5.1 but otherwise things are catch pretty simple second only to the design in terms of strengths is the sound quality with the mw75s we're entering the audiophile territory with an impressively wide Sound Stage bright treble but a fairly neutral overall presentation the step up and quality from Bose is immediately apparent with a far richer and more expansive and detailed sound the base here brings so much more body to your music which just starts to Boom ever so slightly especially at higher volumes and can encroach on the mids that's really the main quality that keeps these away from the top spot still these sound excellent over Bluetooth and you can even unlock 24 bit 96 kilohertz audio with wired listening through USBC but with sound quality or rather sound preference being so subjective the lack of a custom equalizer does let these down these can also reach pretty high volume levels but those smaller cups don't give the tightest acoustic seal to minimize sound leakage for which these ranked only six M D's mw75 are a stylish premium level pair of headphones with awesome sound that are surprisingly good for phone calls there are four stunning color options to choose from but that design is really going to have to pull most of the weight in justifying the high price tag these retail for 599 or 549 pounds next up is Apple's airpods Max just kidding these are overpriced uncomfortable and with so many of the best features being exclusive to iOS they're only a top 7 pair for Apple users next up is actually sennheiser's momentum 4. these come with a hard shell carry case these is a tough fabric exterior a design will see similar variations of later as well elastic straps hold down the USB a to c charging cable a two and a half to three and a half millimeter right angled alt cable so these also use the smaller two and a half millimeter ports an airplane adapter and there's a mesh pouch inside too with the paperwork the momentum 4S are unique in the use of fabric on the headband which looks and feels great and is paired with an otherwise quite simple design with a matte black plastic ear cups the design is something these get criticized for because of the move towards a more modern but generic style compared to the momentum threes that no longer folds down however I personally prefer that these don't use real leather I actually think they look much better now and the new lighter design greatly improves Comfort these use large deep and thick padded ear cups and although the headband padding is much thinner they didn't really cause any soreness there the only potential Comfort issue is the clamping Force which isn't bad necessarily but these are the tightest feeling headphones in this video and consequently there's only scored fifth place for comfort something I quite like though is that the ear cups rotate flat in both directions which is really useful whether you want to hang these around your neck or set them down on your desk you'll find only one physical button here which is used for power Bluetooth pairing battery info and summoning your voice assistant otherwise we have perhaps the most responsive and intuitive touch control system in this video we get all of the regulars for volume and skipping tracks but also extras like pinching to adjust the level of ANC or transparency the wearing detection is also super responsive and can even automatically power on the headphones when you put them on and place calls on hold when you take them off the any control downsides are one no hands-free voice assistant and two the multi-point isn't the most efficient or reliable if you don't pause on the first device before trying to play on the other your music will just play Into The Ether possibly without you knowing sometimes when these couldn't find the second device they would repeatedly interrupt to let me know this with a voice prompt and I did sometimes have connection issues when using two devices at once so there is multi-point but it wasn't the most seamless experience sennheiser's companion app is really good the interface looks great and you're offered good customization over the sound including custom and even personalized equalizers control over the ANC and transparency level including adaptive and wind noise reduction modes and you can even set location-based profiles with custom ANC and sound settings the noise canceling and transparency are the weakest aspects of these headphones the momentum 4 was ranked in seven for both neither is bad and in the real world you'll find both will serve you well in everyday situations but there's quite a substantial gap between these and the likes of Sony and Bose that's worth considering if noise canceling is one of your priorities the same can be said for the call Quality too which was pretty good but there are certainly better options and there's any rate in fifth my voice was usually intelligible on calls even in noisy environments and these have the useful side tone feature so you can adjust how much of your own voice is heard but I find this letting quite a lot of the background noise which can make you harder to hear these are for Bluetooth 5.2 a great codex selection including aptex adaptive and can even play audio via USBC the standout feature is the battery life as these offer a huge 60 hours and that's with ANC turned on this dwarves the competition and comfortably Awards Sennheiser first place for battery life another major strength unsurprisingly is the sound quality these right in third here but the competition for second place was extremely close and will largely come down to your personal preference there was a much bigger Step Up in quality with our sound quality winners but as one of our cheaper entries I'd also say that the momentum Falls offer the best sound quality to price ratio sennheiser's signature open rich and crisp sound is suitable for all genres and volumes we're not quite at audiophile levels in terms of neutrality to my ears there's a slight v-shape boosting the bass and treble but not to the typical overemphasized levels we're used to the separation remains clear and distinct and these are for a well detailed and refined sound this creates a sound signature that I expect will greatly appeal to the masses so even if you don't delve into The Equalizer settings to fine-tune these you'll likely really enjoy the out of the box experience you can crank up the volume and bass if you choose and the plush padding and firm clamping Force keep the sound leakage relatively low which may be useful to know for those looking to not disturb others around them the momentum fours don't offer the most premium design or the best noise canceling performance but they do have a fantastic control scheme amazing battery life and the best sound quality you can get without extending Beyond a 400 price tag they're available for 349 or 299 pounds just before we go on I want to quickly tell you about today's sponsor nordvpn you guys know what a VPN is and I've personally used a bunch of them before but have been particularly impressed with how seamless the Nord experience has been just one tab I'm connected actually that's not true because I use the auto connect feature so I don't even have to do anything I'm essentially just using the internet exactly as I normally would except now I have the benefits of online privacy and security my real IP address and location are hidden I have threat protection from trackers and malware and I can bypass geo-restricted content no matter where I'm traveling I'm currently using it across all of my devices and I just like that one it's actually fast so I get those benefits without a drop in connection speed and two the app interface is great that's something I'm especially enjoying with Nord at the moment so if you want secure and private access to the internet then I'd highly recommend nordvpn they've been kind enough to give me a discount code to offer you guys as well so I'll leave that down in the video description and as a pinned comment now for the entry that's probably the least expected and least well known in Technics eah 800 those of you who watch the earbuds Awards this year know that the Technics earbuds also scored very well you get a leatherette style hard shell case here along with a USB a to c charging cable a right angled aux cable and an airplane adapter now these are the headphones with the least exciting design they don't really use premium materials and the build quality isn't amazing but they score surprisingly well in lots of other categories immediately one redeeming feature is the folding design for easy travel which seems to be becoming less common now they use a hybrid of both physical buttons for the majority of the controls and a very sensitive touchpad which is more limited in its function and reserved just for some ANC and phone call Related controls the buttons are a bit too close together for my liking but overall the controls are fine there's also wearing detection though it can be a little slow but we do get hands-free Alexa integration though sadly not the Google Assistant Comfort is excellent with these and they tick pretty much every Box large spacious ear cups thick padding for the ear cups and headband and a very low clamping Force make these comfortable to wear for hours at a time these aren't the lightest headphones in this video but that's essentially the only reason these place in third for comfort the Technics app experience is simple enough provided you stick to the main two tabs where you'll find lots of customization over the ANC and transparency level and also the sound quality including custom and preset equalizers the settings tab can be a bit overwhelming with a long list of features and settings to customize so there are lots of ways to personalize these headphones but actually most of these settings you can set once and then just ignore connectivity is a major strength we have Bluetooth 5.2 Google Fast pair for quick setup on Android and location tracking and the SBC AAC and ldac codecs so no app text here but there are arguments as to whether ldac the technically higher quality codec is preferred over aptx adaptive the more flexible stable and less power hungry option the best feature though is the multi-point because not all multi-point is created equally you don't need to pause on the first device before switching over you can simply Tap Play on the other device and the sound immediately switches over automatically causing the audio on the first device for you it's extremely satisfying to use and even reconnecting to both devices after powering on the headphones is very fast it's multi-point done right you can also use ldac and multi-point at the same time I mentioned that since it's often the case that they're mutually exclusive battery life here is also excellent at 50 hours with ANC turned on so these are the only other pair that even come close to Sennheiser and there's quite a gap between these and a third placed entry another strong point is the mic quality these are quite an aggressive cancellation of the background noise a setting you can actually increase in the app which works very well in noisy environments but can sometimes clip or buffer your voice generally though these are a great option for phone calls and secured second place for my quality strong mic performance is usually a good indicator for ANC performance and the noise cancellation was indeed really good these do a really good job of blocking out the outside noise and also naturally amplifying it with transparency mode there's great customization over how strong each of these are as well and I like that you can cycle between all three modes with the touch pads my only complaint is that the initial setup for ANC is confusing and it's not clear how exactly it's changing the performance it's not intuitive that the ANC sounded best here these ranked in third overall for both categories but I do feel like there's a noticeable step up with our first and second place entries especially for ANC after a great showing in the sound quality category for Technics earbuds earlier this year I was optimistic about the headphones performance too but the competition is stronger here and sixth place is no mean fees these sound noticeably better than our seventh place bows anyway the a800s offer the most distinct v-shaped EQ of the seven which makes for a consumer-friendly sound profile that will sound good to most people Straight Out of the Box audiophiles may be moaned the slightly booming bass that lacks the control of our higher placed entries and the boosted vocals and treble to compensate for this but it makes for a dynamic energetic and well detailed sound and you can really crank up the volume with these two the clarity is good here we can't quite match sennheiser's cleaner mid-range nor the depth and separation of the mw75 so as great as these sound I think they fall just shy of the audiophile classification these also scored well in the sound leakage test and would make a good choice for keeping your music to yourself the a800s retail for 349 or 299 pounds and whilst their main lack a premium design or a killer feature set to instantly draw you in they offer an undeniably strong overall performance with six second or third place finishes techniques go toe-to-toe with the big names and are well worth considering we'll move on now to the bows and Wilkins px8 these come in one of those tough fabric exterior hard shell cases but have a cool magnetic compartment inside to hold the USBC to C and USB to three and a half millimeter cables like M D's mw75 these are another of the luxury models and the build quality here is simply outstanding from the stitching on the Napa leather to the cast aluminum arms these look and feel extremely high quality the extension on the headband and the rotation of the earcups is satisfyingly smooth and there's some resistance here too which adds to the premium aesthetic so although a non-vegan option is take a clear first place for build quality and look fantastic too these don't fold down for easier travel sadly but like sennheiser's headphones the ear cups rotate flat in both directions those materials do contribute to a relatively High weight though and with a reasonably firm clamping Force they're not as comfortable for longer listening sessions as some of the lighter models fortunately the ear cups are large and spacious and the padding on both the headband and ear cups is very thick and plush so I can still wear these comfortably for hours the px8s are a great example of physical buttons done right they're large and tactile and actually easy to distinguish thanks to the ridge center button they feel great to press these do come with wearing detection although it was a little bit slow even when you set the sensitivity to be high you don't get much in terms of customization either the left side button can either be the ANC mode or The Voice Assistant it seems strange to me that BMW don't even offer a double press option for something else surely that could easily be added through an update these do offer multi-point though and I'm pleased to say that it works like Technics does so pressing play on the other device immediately switches over the audio Source it's awesome connectivity in general was a mixed bag we get Bluetooth 5.2 and great codec choices including aptex adaptive but there's no Google Fast pair and for some strange reason I couldn't get the audio working via USBC there's no AUX port on the headphones so this is actually the only wired option I'm waiting to hear back from BMW about this since there are others reporting this too but for now these don't seem to offer a wired listening option so that's potentially an issue if these run out of battery life which incidentally will happen after 30 hours of playback so that's pretty much on par with the industry standard the overall feature set here is very light you can see in the app there's not much beyond the ANC mode a very basic equalizer for just the bass and treble and a couple of toggles for wearing detection and the auto power off the noise cancellation overall was one of the weaker aspects a step up from Sennheiser and still fairly good but lacking behind the performance of Sony and Bows they definitely take out a lot of the low end frequencies but have little effect on the others beyond what they passively block out In fairness this is a good amount thanks to the Great Seal the ear cups form around your ears and this helps to keep the sound leakage very low as well interestingly the transparency mode was actually great it's Amplified with a bit of a hiss but does make your surroundings really clear after testing the ANC I wasn't too surprised to find that the mic quality also isn't great with these my voice was oddly quiet and slightly muffled so even though these do fairly well with isolating my voice in a noisy environment it can still be hard to hear for the caller so these take sixth place as former winners of the best sounding true wireless earbuds it's no surprise that BMW's over here headphones offer similarly great sound quality performance is offer an open and beautifully refined sound with an expansive Sound Stage the level of clarity and instrument separation in the mid-range in particular is extraordinary for a wireless pair of headphones there's a lot of depth and control over the bass although I'd say the treble isn't quite as crisp as what Sennheiser or M D are offering so I'd personally add a touch of treble to the default War Machine the lack of even a 5 band EQ may put off those who really like to fine-tune their headphones the px8s offer a wonderfully rich and precise audiophile pleasing sound There's A step above the vast majority of competitors I've only heard one pair that can actually beat these BMW's px8 have a clear focus on build quality design and the sound quality so these factors obviously rank at the top for many people and could justify the relatively very high price tag at 699 or 599 pounds others may be looking for a more well-rounded or customizable option but if you're looking for a classy pair with fantastic sound quality that's exactly what you get here the penultimate entry is the bang Olufsen h95 and before we get into it I know some of you will be wondering whether cheaper Ajax model weren't included instead the h95s are insanely expensive and it might appear that the HX model are the more appropriate to compare against the others but the truth is that in testing the 95s overall performed better and more importantly what the HX are good at the h95 take to the next level so the HX end up being still incredibly expensive but also not as good as the 95s they're awkwardly Stuck in the Middle it just felt to me that you're paying this much money for a reason and you can justify that for the 95s but not really the HX so that's why they've made the cards first of all just check out this insane aluminum carry case for the headphones and inside the nylon braided leather strapped USBC charging cable aux cable airplane adapter and even a microfiber cloth you open this case and everything just screams premium quality I mean these even smell good so the overall package is second to none in terms of luxury again we have smooth adjustments of the headband and reassuring resistance when rotating the earcups though not quite as smooth as with the px8 which just snatched the win for the overall build quality the 95s could have easily taken the top spot though with their titanium Fabric and genuine leather Construction again these are one to avoid for the animal lovers but the premium build an aesthetic are on a level you can only expect with such a high price tag these are one of the few especially luxury models that actually fold down one of the benefits over the HX though I can't say these are super travel friendly with that metal case which is just begging to be scratched the weakest aspect of these headphones is the comforts you don't get the largest ear cups here they're quite heavy and the padding is a bit on the thin side the clamping force is reasonably firm though not too tight and despite the materials used the weight is actually kept fairly low so those aren't really the issue it's more the soreness of the crown of your head which I find Creeps in after a few hours of listening what's most interesting about the design is the control scheme because we have a rotating dial on both earcups one side for the volume and the other for the ANC level select the Microsoft Surface headphones this gives you instant intuitive control over these and it works really well my only gripe is that they're kind of loose and they also turn infinitely rather than stopping at the extremes there is a gentle beep when you reach full ANC or transparency and the same with the volume extremes but I think some tactile or better audible feedback as you move over each increment would make this much more satisfying or better still to physically feel some resistance here would have been great and it just doesn't feel like the dials keeper but the otherwise Ultra Premium feel we also have a metal switch for the power and Bluetooth pairing a single button on the left for the voice assistant and the right ear cup has a touchpad for the usual play pause and skipping tracks it's responsive and works well one disappointment though there's no wearing detection feature wise the experience is pretty Bare Bones in the app you'll find a slider for the ANC level toggles for the Adaptive mode Windows reduction and the autopower feature and there are also some preset eqs and a custom mode which is very easy to use especially for those unfamiliar with equalizers but for headphones aimed at audio files I would have hoped for a bit more precise control over the sound the noise canceling and transparency here is fairly good but these are really only a middle of the pack performer and again there's quite a step up for the market leaders normally this wouldn't be so much of an issue but since these are so expensive one would hope for better performance like the others in this list they're still going to block out enough sound in most situations you'll find yourself in but don't expect great ANC or transparency here on the plus side the passive noise isolation is quite good thanks to a good seal forward with the ear cups and these actually offer the least sound leakage from any of the finalists in keeping with our theme of average ANC suggests average mic quality these were okay for phone calls they're not great they do a fairly good job of rejecting background noise which places them above Sennheiser in fourth for my quality the Revelation course still wasn't super loud or clear so these aren't great in noisy environments especially connectivity is interesting because we get Bluetooth 5.1 a good codex selection including aptx adaptive and support for both Google Fast pair and Microsoft Swift pair these also have multi-point sadly not the Super far switching multi-points you still have to pause on the first device beforehand and actually I did have some stuttering issues at first when switching over so that's an overall pretty good mix but sadly these don't play audio via USBC and even worse they don't work passively with the cable when the headphones are switched off so wired listening isn't an option for when the battery runs out these are the only headphones here for giving the px8s for now that aren't able to do this fortunately the battery life is really good you get 38 hours with ANC turned on which ranks these in third place but then we get to sound quality where these are really in A League of Their Own there were some comparisons that were very close to cool like Sennheiser vs m d but with the h95 it just felt like nothing else could match the clarity and precision over the sound what sets these apart from the rest and I do think these open up a sound quality gap over the others is how wide The Sound Stage is and how clear the instrument separation is listening with these I was hearing details and drags I'd never heard before and to me this feels like the most accurate representation of the original sound from any pair of bluetooth headphones I've tested the base here is so natural and well controlled in fact it might even seem underwhelming to an average consumer since the majority of headphones are bass boosted the only other potential drawback to mention is that these don't get super loud like most of the others either but there's no muddying of the other frequencies and when balanced with an open and clear mid-range and crisp treble this is a sound that true audio files will appreciate and this is what I mean about justifying the price of the h95s not everyone has nine hundred dollars to spend on Bluetooth headphones but if you want the very best sound quality then you can justify getting these so that let's face it ridiculous price tag is going to immediately alienate the majority of people and that's totally understandable especially when features like the mic quality and the noise cancellation don't justify it but there's a very clear Market which these headphones are aimed at and it's those looking for a luxury package and class leading sound quality and our final entry is for sure going to be the least surprising of all which is Sony's wh-1000x M5 and I have to hand it to Sony there are a lot of great things about these headphones I'll start with actually the packaging Sony is the only company bothering to use sustainable materials for the packaging tech companies it literally doesn't matter what the packaging looks like but choices like this really benefit the environment so well done Sony the charging case is another of those tough fabric exterior ones and inside like the px8 case there's a magnetic compartment for the accessories a USB AC charging cable and a right angled aux cable let's start with arguably the weakest aspect which is the design and build quality it seems strange calling this a weak aspect because actually it's still really good here it's just that we're dealing with the very best headphones on the market so the lack of Premium materials here places Sony in fifth for build quality the minimal matte black design is similar to previous iterations from Sony the big change this year is a shift towards a non-folding design with earcups that only rotate away from you so you trade some travel convenience for structural integrity I think the single most surprising result from the entire testing period was Sony's first place for Comfort I mentioned that one pair somehow beat Bose's quiet Comfort headphones and it turned out to be the mark fives these are super lightweight at 250 grams they have the biggest and most spacious ear cups of all and an ultra low clamping Force so they took every box the padding is actually reasonably thin but you simply don't need it to be any thicker with these and actually this helps with keeping ear warming to a minimum the only downside is that without a very tight seal there is a bit more sound leakage than most of the others but what you gain in Comfort is totally worth it and I can happily wear these for hours on end the controls we have two buttons on the left for power battery and Bluetooth pairing and the other for changing the ANC mode on the right ear cup there's a touchpad to the music controls which are all very responsive my personal favorite is quick attention where you can cover the right ear cup to temporarily lower the music volume and turn on transparency mode which is so useful if you only need to quickly hear your surroundings I don't know if Sony has patented this but it's mad that no one else seems to be doing it too these also offer speak to chats a similar but hands-free feature for automatic transparency which you can customize in the app there's also hands-free hey Google and Alexa integration built-in Spotify tab wiring detection multi-point it's clear the mark files take a deserved first place for the controls as well for connectivity we have Bluetooth 5.2 Google Fast pair and Microsoft Swift pair and the SBC AAC and ldot codecs so that's all good except that multi-point and Dell DAC can't be used at the same time which is why I made the point that you can do this with the Technics headphones you can keep listening passively by the aux cable when these run out of battery and these offer 30 hours of playback with ANC turned on so that's pretty much the industry standard now but only Awards only fifth place for battery it will likely come as no surprise to tell you to the mark 5's noise cancellation is fantastic somehow a step up from the also great Mark IVs and these block out a huge amount of external noise with no hissing sound either I mentioned the low clamping force and the lack of a super Tight Seal so this goes to show just how much work the ANC is doing these don't have to rely on passive noise isolation and can still be extremely comfortable whilst offering excellent ANC this only just beaten by Bose these two really are in A League of Their Own though when it comes to noise cancellation it's superb although Beau is a slightly more powerful at blocking out noise Sony's ANC is more advanced and has some advantages I mentioned quick attention and speak to chat already but there's also features like adaptive sound control which gives you automatic switching of custom ANC profiles based on either your movement or location Sony has been doing this for a while now and the feature is pretty well optimized the mark files have automatic NC optimization for the environment too including for air pressure changes so combined with the best Comfort there's actually no better pair for a long-haul flight or really any kind of travel one of the things I noticed when compared to Bose is the lack of the cabin pressure-like sensation when using ANC I feel it slightly with Bose's se but not at all with Sony's Mark 5S and finally the simple fact that I can easily turn Ambient sound off with these is a huge plus Bose forces you to use either ANC or transparency which drains the battery even if you don't need it so overall Sony could easily have taken the ANC award instead I should also mention that the transparency mode is excellent the best in this video there is a tiny hiss so it isn't perfect but you do get the clearest amplification of your surroundings with these and you're able to adjust the transparency level in the app based on that ANC and transparency performance it came as no surprise that the mark 5's my quality was excellent but what did surprise me was how much better it was than the mark IVs and the rest of the competition these take first place by a big margin no other headphones can compete with the volume and Clarity of my voice and it could even use these for calls in noisy environments I think the main aspect letting these headphones down is the sound quality Sony still has a warm bass focused sound signature that's lacking the detail precision and accuracy of the market leaders the bass is actually Tighter and more controlled than the previous Mark IVs this is the best sound Sony has offered and there's more control than say Technics headphones there's a lot of depth and volume with the sound too loads of customization with the mini preset or custom equalizers and even an albeit limited spatial audio feature but there's still an emphasis on the low end and the rolled off treble though Pleasant sounding and free from any harsh sibilance is lacking that sharpness and detail that would balance out the sound again it seems strange talking about sound quality as a sort of weakness because if you're not an audio file then any one of these with the exception of Bose perhaps is going to sound really good of all the hundreds of ANC headphones on the market these still sound comparatively fantastic and lots of people actually like Sony's base Focus tuning but an audio file listening to these and then switching to the px8s or the h95s will instantly notice that step up and quality in particular with regards to balance and clarity Sony's wh-1000xm5 are clearly an extremely well-rounded pair of headphones with a great feature set 349 or 299 pounds they undercut those premium Alternatives that offer Superior sound quality but also beaten for Comfort controls and the ANC and mic performance they're certainly an attractive all-rounder and comfortably make it into this year's headphones Awards okay so we covered a lot of information there but let's break down what all of it means first of all here are the final rankings for all seven pairs of headphones you can immediately pick out the strengths and weaknesses for each one you may notice now that the order I review them in was from worst to best according to their overall performance bows in 7th and Sony in first Sony not only scored the best all-round performance but also the highest number of wins with four statistically it is by far the overall winner and the best pair of bluetooth headphones you can buy right now but everyone has their own specific factors that they prioritize for instance if you want the best sounding headphones then Sony may be no good and the same if you want one of the more luxury models with a premium build quality so you may be looking more towards bno or bows and Wilkins but you should factor in that there's a comfort versus luxury trade-off the top three most comfortable pairs were actually 5th 6th and seventh in build quality but even if there was an objective winner that doesn't mean that it's your winner equally seventh doesn't mean bad it just means not as good as the other six in some cases only very slightly Bose's SE scored the most Seventh Place finishes for instance but if your priorities and noise canceling and comfort then they may be your winner anyway most of us will have to take price into consideration too and actually if you look at the cost adjusted table you'll see changes like the h95s drop from second into sixth and Bose move up from Seventh into fourth once again though Sony's m5s are still the overall winner after factoring in the price and to throw my two cents in I would pick Sony's m5s on a personal level as well they still sound good enough for me and if I really wanted true audiophile level sound quality then I wouldn't be looking at Bluetooth headphones they would be my recommendation to most people and hopefully you can now see why in fact they're so good that even the previous mark IV share most of the same great features you should be able to find those now at an even cheaper price obviously I couldn't go into Super in-depth detail on each model here so as to keep the video concise at ham over 30 minutes but hopefully this breakdown has been helpful and if so then please drop a like to let me know if you have any questions about these or one of the many other pairs that were tested then leave a comment and I'll do my

What works for some people doesn’t work for others, and few product categories are as diverse as headphones. In-ears, on-ears, over-ears—there’s just so much to choose from, and it’s hard to tell what’s right for you.\n\nEditor’s note: This list was updated on March 10, 2023 to include the Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless as a top pick, and the Beyerdynamic DT 900 PRO X, Google Pixel Buds A-Series, Grado SR80x, Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, Sennheiser HD 660S2, and Shure SE215 in the Notable mentions, add isolation and frequency response charts for the AKG K371, and to update formatting.\n\nWhere are the frequency response charts? For our top five picks, you can find the isolation and frequency response charts at the end of each image gallery. You can learn more about how to read our charts here.\n\nWhy is the Sony WH-1000XM5 the best pair of noise cancelling headphones? Now that Sony has released the Sony WH-1000XM5, it takes the crown as the best active noise cancelling (ANC) headphones. This new model outperforms its closest competitors in noise attenuation and microphone quality. The default frequency response is a bit bassier than what we typically recommend, but you can easily equalize this from the Sony Headphones Connect app (iOS/Android) or your preferred third-party equalizer. To see frequency response and isolation charts for any of our top picks, scroll to the end of each photo gallery.\n\nThe WH-1000XM5 offers top-of-the-line specs and features, including a custom equalizer, Sony’s 360 Reality Audio, and auto-pause/play sensors. The Sony WH-1000MX5 includes speak-to-chat, which pauses your media when you are speaking to someone and resumes playback 30 seconds after so you don’t miss the person’s response. You also have Bluetooth multipoint which is a great productivity feature for those who like to keep an ear on their phone while connected to their laptop. The microphone system is among the best we’ve seen in a headset like this and cancels out background noise effectively no matter the conditions. Take a listen to two of our microphone demos below!

Now featuring new drivers, it's an intriguing set of headphones among the flagship active noise-cancelling (ANC) devices on the market. Not only is it full of useful features, but it also excels in travel or at the office, in particular. $398.00 at Amazon $398.00 at Crutchfield $398.00 at Best Buy $399.99 at Walmart\n\nShould you get the Sony WH-1000XM4 instead of the Sony WH-1000XM5? The Sony WH-1000XM5 (left) looks a bit cleaner than the WH-1000XM4 (right). When comparing the Sony WH-1000XM5 to the WH-1000XM4, it’s clear that these headphones are closely related. Even though the XM5 model has better ANC and sound quality to boot, the Sony WH-1000XM4 is still worth getting if you don’t want to spend as much money. The fourth-generation headset shares many of the premium features found on the WH-1000XM5 and you can expect the older model to go on sale. If you want a budget alternative, the Sony WH-XB910N is a solid ANC headset if you can find it. However, you’ll only save $100, as the price tag is most often around $250. The fact of the matter is that good ANC is tough to get at a good price, and Sony currently has the best.\n\nThe Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) is the best set of wireless earbuds for iPhone owners True wireless earphones took the market by storm after being dominated by the Apple AirPods for so long. Now there’s plenty of competition, much of which offers a more compelling experience than most of Apple’s audio products. However, with the company’s latest release, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) is back on top of the pole for iOS users. These buds offer great ANC, sound quality to match, and sound better than the AirPods (3rd generation) simply by virtue of the fact that they can seal your ear canal.\n\nApple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) 7.4 Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Buy now See review See review\n\nThese earbuds bring a big improvement to ANC and battery life, and the retain the same IPX4 rating, which now also covers the charging case. Speaking of the charging case, that’s where a lot of the more notable changes come. The AirPods Pro (2nd generation) charging case features Apple’s new U1 chip, which makes it compatible with Apple’s Find My service and the new integrated speakers will emit a noise to help you find it.\n\nMuch like all the other AirPods, this is best used with Apple devices. It only supports SBC and AAC Bluetooth codecs, so there’s no high quality codec for android users. Also, many of the earbuds software features are found in the iOS settings app, so you’ll miss out on other platforms in that respect too. Still, this is about as good as it gets for wireless earbuds for Apple users.\n\nHow does the microphone sound on the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation)? The AirPods Pro mic sounds best in quiet environments but can filter out some background noise. Listen to our samples below.

With support for a variety of high quality codecs like AAC, aptX, aptX HD, and aptX Adaptive, plus a 3.5mm headphone jack and USB-C listening, you’ll hardly ever get caught without a connection. You even get Bluetooth multipoint. More to the point, a stellar 56 hours and 21 minutes of battery life (with ANC on) outperforms most headphones.\n\nSennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless 8.5 Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless Buy now See review See review\n\nWhile the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless doesn’t beat out the Sony WH-1000XM5 on noise cancelling, the ANC onboard is still rather effective and adjustable. That sound experts at Sennheiser tune the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless to sound frankly great, is unsurprising. It gets very close to our target curve with just a bit more bass. However, if that sound is not your preference, you can utilize the Smart Control app to adjust EQ. In addition you can create automatic listening settings for different locations and adjust ANC.\n\nThe touch controls are intuitive, and little luxuries like on-ear detection contribute to the overall flagship worthy experience of the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless. That you get a carry case and an airplane adapter means you don’t have to shell out for accessories either. Plus, the Sennheiser cans undercut the price of most premium headphones without significant compromises.\n\nSennheiser Momentum 4 Sennheiser Momentum 4 App for EQ changes • Simple, elegant design • USB-C charging High-end ANC over-ear headphones focus on style and comfort If you need total immersion in your music, you need some ANC over-ears.

The microphone system of the Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless should be able to pick up voice sounds.

The AKG K371 offers a really good baseline for what constitutes good sound in the consumer market.\n\nAKG K371 AKG K371 8.1 AKG K371 AKG K371 Buy now See review See review\n\nThat’s not because these are super bassy, or that they’re flashy—if anything they’re the opposite of both. This pair of headphones sounds excellent for what it is, and provides a really good double-life as a dependable studio monitor. Sure, these are a set of wired cans with a rather cumbersome cable. But if you’re listening at home, mixing a track, or working at the coffee shop: these are the headphones you want.\n\nAKG K371 AKG K371 Excellent sound • Replaceable parts • Great sound One of the best wired headphones on the market The AKG K371 is one of the best over-ear headphones combining sound quality, comfort, functionality, and portability.

Sure, that sounds a little weird to say for a set of $300 USD planar magnetic headphones, but our testing shows the Sundara does an excellent job at providing listeners with good sound quality when compared to its closest competitors.\n\nHiFiMan Sundara HiFiMan Sundara 7.9 HiFiMan Sundara HiFiMan Sundara Buy now See review See review\n\nHowever, many headphones in this bracket are very heavy and uncomfortable, and the Sundara has this issue to an extent. However, the choice to use cloth in the padding of the ear cups and the form-fitting band do a lot to make this product far more comfortable to use for those who wear eyeglasses. If you don’t wear eyeglasses, all the better.\n\nOf course, as open-back headphones, these let in just about every sound around you. So be sure to note that before you start spending like crazy. Additionally, if you’d like to equalize these headphones any: you’re probably going to want an amplifier of some sort to avoid volume issues.\n\nHiFiMan Sundara HiFiMan Sundara Excellent sound • 3.5mm TRS jack • Low sound distortion A pair of high-end level sound quality open-backed headphones The HiFiMan Sundara is an open-backed headset that diminishes the resonance issues in the bass and offers an excellent, natural-like sound. $299.00 at Amazon\n\nWhy should you consider the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700?\n\nThe Bose NCH 700 features touch controls and have three buttons in total, one of which is for pairing, another is for controlling the level of ANC, and a third which activates Google Assistant.\n\nWhile the ANC on the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 may not be as impressive as the company’s Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones, Bose has shown commitment to users by improving the ANC with a comprehensive firmware updates (version 1.8.2). You can view the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 ANC chart.\n\nWe also like the NCH 700 for its sleek design and seemingly perfect touch controls. Many companies make calibrate their headsets’ touch panels to be too sensitive, resulting in many misfires, but Bose’s headset is a breeze to operate. The default frequency response (chart) is excellent and requires little fixing, but you can change it directly from the Bose Music app (iOS/Android) if you’d like.\n\nHow does the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 microphone sound? Those with unusually low voices may sound a bit “off” or “hollow” to those on the other end but this is to mitigate the proximity effect. For the most part, the NCH 700 microphone is quite good in all contexts since it filters out quite a bit of environmental noise.

Budget-conscious audiophiles would be doing themselves a disservice by not giving these a spin.\n\nThere are a few minor differences between the HD 6XX and the HD 650 ($304.78 at Amazon), but most are cosmetic in nature. The performance of the HD 6XX is top-notch, and is much lighter than it looks. If you’re the kind of listener who spends a lot of time at the computer, this is the kind of headphones you should be looking for. Just be aware that the open back is a double-edged sword: it allows for better sound quality and clarity, but it also lets in all the outside noise around you.\n\nThe best headphones: Notable mentions We can’t highlight every headset the way we’d like, so instead, we’ve put together a bulleted list of alternative standouts that didn’t quite make the best headphones cut.\n\nThe Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 3.0 supports aptX for high-quality streaming on Android devices.\n\nHold up! Something’s different: Some of our picks’ frequency response and isolation charts were measured with our old testing system. We have since purchased a Bruel & Kjaer 5128 test fixture (and the appropriate support equipment) to update our testing and data collection. It will take a while to update our backlog of old test results, but we will update this article (and many others!) once we’re able with improved sound quality measurements and isolation performance plots. These will be made obvious with our new chart aesthetic (black background instead of white). Thank you for bearing with us, and we hope to see you again once we’ve sorted everything out.\n\nIf you want more portable options, check out these earbuds\n\nThe new stabilizers help give the MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 a more universal fit than its predecessor.\n\nWhat you should know about the best headphones\n\nLily Katz / SoundGuys Open-back headphones are really only for at-home use, limiting their functionality compared to closed-back ones.\n\nCalling something “the best” at anything is controversial at best, so we create our best lists with the caveat that your experiences may vary from our own. Sometimes people have a unique set of needs, and that can’t be satisfied by going to a list of “best headphones” because the article doesn’t address what the best headphones out there are… for you. Consequently, we encourage all of our readers to write down all the things they want out of their headphones first—before rolling the dice on a pick. This list has a lot of all-time greats, but if you need something a little bit more tailored to your needs, definitely keep reading our other lists and features to arm yourself with enough knowledge to make the right purchase.\n\nThink hard about what types of headphones you like (in ears? over ears? on ears?), and also try to figure out what features you need. Maybe you need to go to the store to see how they fit on your head? Do you wear glasses or have ear piercings? Maybe you should look into getting velour pads instead of leather! These are all things covered in our reviews and other best lists.\n\nAre wired headphones better than Bluetooth headphones?\n\nWired headphones like the Monolith by Monoprice M1070C have their place but they also come with compromises like portability and convenience.\n\nThis list has a few wired options if you want great sound, but we also have a few wireless options if you prefer convenience. If you opt for a Bluetooth pair, there are a few things you should know. First and foremost, the rumors you’ve heard are true. Bluetooth just can’t party with wired headphones, at least as it pertains to sound quality. Even some of the best codecs available aren’t as great as they seem at first glance. AAC is basically only good if you’re on an iOS device which means Android users should probably stick to aptX, and LDAC isn’t truly hi-res. The good news is that you most likely can’t hear any of the details in the data that’s being dropped, but it’s still not a great selling point. Of course, if you do think that you have superhuman hearing feel free to test yourself with our simple hearing test.\n\nThere is hope, though: Bluetooth SIG announced LE Audio and the LC3 codec, an efficient alternative to SBC. We’re excited to see the benefits to the hard-of-hearing community play out in the real world, and know that LC3 will provide a 50% increase in audio quality relative to SBC. What’s more, headphone stutters will be lessened as packet-loss-management is improved, so instead of hearing annoying, intermittent drops, the dropout process will be much smoother. Even the best headphones will benefit from the new codec.\n\nWhat are Bluetooth codecs? We mentioned codecs in the last section, but what exactly is a Bluetooth codec? If Bluetooth is the technology that enables two devices to communicate with each other, then codecs can be thought of as the language that they speak. When two devices speak the same language, they can communicate faster and send more data between each other which results in better sound quality. Some of the best codecs have high transfer rates if both devices are compatible, and if they aren’t then everything just reverts down to the basic codec called SBC. Unfortunately, codecs can be a bit finicky and as we mentioned before don’t always work the way they’re intended to which is why wired headphones usually sound better. Though it is worth mentioning that Qualcomm’s aptX adaptive that seems promising, but we’ll have to wait to test it ourselves before we get our hopes up.\n\nHow does active noise cancelling work? If you were wondering how active noise cancellation works, don’t worry you’re not alone. There’s a lot that goes into it and some companies like Bose and Sony have their own ways of achieving it technologically, but it all comes down to basic physics. Active noise cancelling is actually something called destructive interference. If you take one wave with an amplitude of +1 and combine it with another wave that has an amplitude of -1, you’re left with zero.\n\nConstructive and Destructive Interference Sound waves of equal amplitude, offset at 1/2 wavelengths result in compression waves with an amplitude of 0—canceling out the sound.\n\nActive noise cancelling headphones take advantage of this by using tiny microphones to hear what sounds are around you and then creating an opposite sound wave to cancel that before it reaches your ears. Of course, this isn’t perfect and works better for long, droning sounds then sudden, screeching ones. So don’t expect ANC headphones to block out that crying baby on your next flight. But when you combine noise cancelling technology with good isolation, you can get pretty close to completely blocking the outside world.\n\nThis is harder to achieve when it comes to earbuds, as they don’t completely cover your ear. So instead, a solid pair of memory foam ear tips might be worth looking into as they do a better job at isolating sound than the silicone ones that come with most buds.\n\nHow we choose the best headphones\n\nIf it’s a gaming headset we game with it, if it’s a workout headset we work out with it, and so on.\n\nIf you’d seen this list before, you’ll probably notice that it’s completely different than it was in years past. Now it’s a perpetually updated piece. Gone is the Sennheiser HD 800, and the rest of the exorbitantly expensive headphones. That’s because we realized that what’s “best” objectively, isn’t what’s “best” for everyone… so our selections needed a bit of tweaking.\n\nJust like it is with power tools and kitchen utensils, different headphones are built for different purposes. Using the right tool for the job is important, and ensures that you get the best experience possible. You wouldn’t use a chainsaw to cut butter any more than you’d use a set of AKG K7XX on an airplane.\n\nWe tested the Sony WH-1000XM5 in the lab with state-of-the-art equipment like the B&K 5128.\n\nIn that light, we took extra time to take into account how most people actually use headphones. What makes a good pair of gym headphones? What makes a good pair of wireless earbuds? What’s the good in having a best headphones list that doesn’t help most people buy headphones they like?\n\nWhile we took the time to highlight some Bluetooth headphones, active noise cancelers, and open-backed cans—be sure to read the descriptions to see if they’re right for you. Many people want a set of headphones that will do everything, but those models are few and far between. That’s why our winner isn’t a set of headphones you’d see on other outlets’ top 10. It’s more about what people actually want than what’s objectively the best performing set out there.\n\nWho is this list for? While many might be upset that we chose more consumer-geared models than the stunning halo products of audiophile lore: it’s important to us that our readers aren’t dissatisfied with their headphones. To that end, we find that the ultra-expensive headphones are generally a poor fit for most, often leaving your average consumer frustrated and feeling like they wasted a lot of money. Those with a more developed idea of what kind of headphones they want should also check out our other best lists. Not every best headphone model listed here will meet all of your needs. With that being said, all of our picks were used by at least one team member, and all of these picks sound fantastic. Because our ad-free business model relies on you enjoying your headphones without returning them, this list represents what we earnestly feel is the most deserving of your money. We knew that we wanted to create a list of financially attainable headphones that meet realistic use cases, rather a drool-inducing, unrealistic list for your average consumer.\n\nWhy you should trust SoundGuys on the best headphones In short, you should trust us because we show our work, strive to provide as much unimpeachable information to you, and pin our revenue model on the happiness of our readers with our recommendations. If you return the product we suggest, we don’t see a dime.\n\nWe do what it takes to test the best headphones, including napping.\n\nWhen it comes to audio, the SoundGuys team has years of experience reviewing products between them (and even more listening to them). Chris spent years reviewing audio products, among other things, at publications such as USA Today and Reviewed.com, Lily clocked in countless hours at radio stations and reviewing products independently before joining our team, and Adam has been listening to headphones and speakers for nearly five years as part of SoundGuys. So needless to say, if a product makes best headphones list it’s because we were genuinely impressed by them and had some hands-on experience with them (or at the very least put in hours of research).\n\nFrequently asked questions about the best headphones\n\nWhat are the best wireless headphones that have everything you need? I wish I could give you a definitive answer of one perfect pair of wireless headphones, but truthfully, the answer to this question depends on your personal preferences. Do you want really good active noise cancelling? Go for the Apple AirPods Max or Sony WH-1000XM5. Are you looking for great wireless sound quality and don’t want to spend a fortune? Check out the Audio-Technica AT-M50xBT2. Is long battery life important to you? Try the Anker Soundcore Space Q45. There are a lot of good headphones out there, and we do our best to outline all the objective facts and describe our subjective experiences with each product so you can make an informed decision based on your personal priorities.\n\nWhat about the Apple AirPods Max? The Apple AirPods Max are bound to be a fine pair of headphones for any iPhone user, but the noise cancelling headset is extremely cost-prohibitive. It affords a lot to the right listener, though. Each ear cup houses Apple’s H1 chip for extensive processing power so the headset can deftly perform tasks like hybrid ANC, passthrough audio, hands-free Siri access, Spatial Audio, and more. If you have multiple Apple devices all synced up to the same iCloud account, you’ll enjoy automatic device switching.",
        "https://www.rtings.com/headphones/reviews/best/headphones": "From this price point onwards, Anker dominates the market. Their Q lineup targets each price range, and most options in the lineup are well-equipped with features like ANC, multi-device pairing, and companion app support, which make them hard to ignore. That said, their top-of-the-line model is the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless, which are significantly cheaper than the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless, but come with a step down in build quality and comfort, as well as shorter continuous battery life. Still, they offer a few of the same features and have a comparable noise cancelling performance. Their ANC does a fantastic job of blocking out a wide range of ambient sound, although it's not quite as effective with bass-range sounds like rumbling engines as the Sony. You can set the ANC to different levels manually or use the 'Adaptive ANC' feature to adjust automatically to your surroundings.\n\nTheir v-shaped default sound profile is well-suited for genres like pop and rock and can also be customized with a graphic EQ and presets in the companion app. They also support LDAC, Sony's proprietary codec for hi-res audio. They last for around 27 hours of continuous use and have physical controls in the form of buttons on the ear cups, which you might prefer if you want to adjust the volume while wearing gloves. Unlike the Sony headphones, they don't have virtual surround sound or customization options like button mapping, but they support multi-device pairing and NFC for quicker pairing.",

The audio quality is rich and exuberant, the noise cancellation is strong, they work wired or wireless, and they offer great battery life. For some very affordable earbuds that offer excellent audio quality, the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus remain among our favorites – they're just an incredible price these days. Matt Bolton, Managing Editor – Entertainment\n\nThe best headphones are a must if you love listening to music, podcasts and movies. They’re essential if you travel regularly, have a lot of video calls, need music to focus while you’re working or to keep you motivated while you’re working out.\n\nThere are many different types of headphones out there, and new ones are launched every week, which means finding the best headphones or the best earbuds for you isn’t easy. You have to consider several factors, including your budget, the features you need and any preferences you have about how they look and fit.\n\nFor sheer sound quality you can't beat a good pair of wired headphones. But if you want the convenience of cable-free listening there are some excellent unwired options too. In fact, there are so many that we've put together two separate guides: one for the best wireless headphones and one for the best true wireless earbuds.\n\nWe've also put together a guide to the best noise-cancelling headphones. They're particularly good for travelling or for drowning out the ambient noise of open-plan offices. If you're on a tight budget, though, some of the best over-ear headphones' ear cups do a pretty good job of cutting out ambient noise without any technological trickery.\n\nWe've spent many happy hours testing the best earbuds and headphones over the years and over our ears, and we know exactly what makes a great pair of cans or buds: sound quality, of course, but also comfort and convenience. And you don't necessarily need to spend huge sums of money to get all three of those things, as this guide demonstrates.\n\nThere's a huge variety of headphones and earbuds here, but they share important features that make them easy to recommend. Those features include comfortable design, class-leading audio performance, and useful extra features such as built-in voice assistants or rock-solid wireless connectivity. Whether you want to listen with your smartphone, laptop, or one of the best MP3 players, you won't be disappointed with any of these pairs – but if you're looking for gaming headphones with built-in mics, we'd suggest checking out our best PC gaming headset guide, as that's laser-focused on gaming performance, surround sound and in-game chat.\n\nThe best headphones 2023: our picks\n\n(Image credit: Sony)\n\nThe Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones deliver excellent noise-cancellation and sound quality in a design that we found comfortable and lightweight throughout our testing.\n\nThey don’t look different from their predecessors, the Sony WH-1000XM3. However, new features, including multipoint pairing, DSEE Extreme upscaling, conversational awareness and auto-play/pause using a built-in sensor, mean they’re a significant upgrade.\n\nThe WH-1000XM4 headphones also support Sony’s 360 Reality Audio format, which delivers spatial audio on stereo headphones, plus the LDAC codec that can send a bitrate of up to 990 kbps. However, it no longer supports aptX or aptX HD, so your hi-res audio support mileage may vary.\n\nThere are a wonderful pair of wireless noise-cancelling headphones and deliver exactly what they promise and then some thanks to their exceptional noise cancellation and cutting-edge codec support.\n\nRead our full Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Headphones review\n\n(Image credit: Cambridge Audio)\n\nNow that they've received a permanent price cut, dragging that tag down to more than half its original price, the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus are a much more appealing option than ever. Not that they weren't already at their original cost, receiving the coveted five-star rating in our review.\n\nA clear upgrade from its predecessors, these offering excellent audio performance, a helpful app, and easy-to-use controls. In terms of audio quality, we found during testing that they offer tons of dynamism and character, with a lively presentation, high accuracy, and a lot of detail.\n\nAnd, while there's no noise cancellation on offer, the sound isolation is very good. Finally, if you're ok with using them in low power mode, you should get up to nine hours of battery life per earbuds charge (up to 45 hours with the case).\n\nRead our full Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus review\n\n(Image credit: Sennheiser)\n\nWe said under intense review that Sennheiser's welcome update to its 2019 Sennheiser Momentum third-generation Wireless headphones would soon be sitting pretty within this buying guide, and here they are. The Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless are the newest August 2022-issue wireless over-ear headphones from Sennheiser and if Sony (listed above and below) isn't worried, it should be.\n\nThese cans boast an incredible 60-hour battery life, a likeable app, an extensive feature set, easy on-ear controls, talented adaptive noise cancellation and a zealous sound that'll have you nodding your head happily wherever you go. Yes, they're a tad plain aesthetically, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and these headphones sound outrageously good for the level.\n\nSennheiser has packed everything and the kitchen sink into the Momentum 4 Wireless’s spec sheet, including Sidetone to better hear your voice during calls and 'Sound Zones', EQ and ANC presets which can be set to magically kick in when you're, well, in the zone. Make no mistake though, the headline-grabber is still the sound. And what a sound it is! Think open, detailed, expansive, neutral and crisp. Never is it overly warm; never is it congested or muddied through the bass.\n\nMove over Sony XM5, there's a new set of cans in town and honestly, they're just that little bit better across the board. Oh, also, they're a little cheaper than the XM5…\n\nRead our full Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless review\n\n(Image credit: Sony)\n\n4. Sony WH-1000XM5 The best Sony headphones if you don't mind paying the price Our expert review: Specifications Acoustic design: Closed Weight: 250g Frequency response: 4Hz to 40kHz Drivers: 1.18-inch dome-type Battery life: 40 hours Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Crutchfield (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Superb noise cancelling + Excellent audio performance + Useful ambient features Reasons to avoid - More expensive - Not a huge upgrade over the XM4s\n\nThese new Sonys would be at the top of our table if it weren't for the fact that right now the outgoing model, the WH-1000XM4, is substantially cheaper and does almost everything the newer Sonys do. These are better headphones, but at the moment the XM4s are the better buy.\n\nIn our Sony WH-1000XM5 review we said that the XM5s are \"the best headphones in the world thanks to their class-leading noise-cancelling features and well-balanced audio\". However, \"a steeper price point and similar functionality to earlier models make the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones an ever-so-slightly tougher sell than before.\"\n\nThe new design is more elegant and contains slightly smaller drivers than before, and while there's less wind distortion the trade-off is that they don't fold neatly like the previous model did. The noise cancelling is best-in-class, doing an excellent job of muting the higher pitched sounds that ANC headphones tend to find challenging, and sound quality is exemplary. Your co-workers or fellow commuters won't take a dislike to you either: these headphones don't leak as badly as some over-ears do.\n\nThe other headline feature here is battery life, which is now 10 hours longer: expect up to 40 hours with the ANC off and 30 with it on.\n\nIf you don't already have noise cancelling headphones, these are as good as it currently gets – but the older, cheaper model is almost as good and better value as a result.\n\nRead our full Sony WH-1000XM5 review\n\n(Image credit: Sony)\n\nWith the Sony WF-1000XM4s, Sony has combined performance, ergonomics, and build quality more effectively than ever before in a noise-cancelling true wireless package. During our testing we found that compared to their predecessors, the Sony WF-1000XM3, the newer wireless earbuds offer enough quality-of-life features to make them worth upgrading to, even if they are a little more expensive. Features like auto-pause and being able to tune the buds to the shape of your ears are truly useful.\n\nWhile other true wireless earbuds surpass the Sony WF-1000XM4 in particular areas – in terms of noise cancellation, for example – no other model comes close to offering such excellent quality across the board. That’s why the Sony WF-1000XM4 are hands-down the best true wireless earbuds you can buy today.\n\nRead our full Sony WF-1000XM4 review\n\n(Image credit: Apple)\n\n6. Apple AirPods Pro 2 The best noise-cancelling earbuds for Apple fans Average Amazon review: (opens in new tab) ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Acoustic design: Closed Weight: 5.3g each Frequency response: Not listed Drivers: Custom Apple design Battery life : 6 hours (earbuds) 30 hours (charging case) Today's Best Deals View at Walmart (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Best Buy (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Elite active noise cancellation + Great audio quality + Lots of smart features for iPhone users Reasons to avoid - Average battery life for buds - No aptX or LDAC support\n\nThe Apple AirPods Pro 2 offer improved audio performance over the original AirPods Pro and fantastic ANC in a comfortable, true wireless form factor.\n\nThe Pro 2 buds are a step up from the original AirPods Pro. Design changes might be subtle, but audio performance is upgraded with new drivers and amplifiers. During our testing, we rated the sound from the Pro 2 as brilliant—there’s rich audio across genres and a wide and expansive soundstage.\n\nANC is also greatly improved and performs exceptionally well, we found it blocked out most external noises. Transparency mode is more useful too. It's adaptive, allowing you to have natural conversations when you don’t want to take them out.\n\nBattery life has been boosted to 6 hours from the buds with ANC on, and 30 hours from the charging case, which is now IPX4 water resistant—withstanding light showers and sweating—and has a speaker, handy if you lose them as you can activate a 'Find My' request.\n\nWe still rate the original AirPods Pro, but the Pro 2 are one of our favorite options if you're looking for a pair of the best headphones in a true wireless design. If you want the comfort of over-ear headphones, there are better headphones on this list, like the Sony WH-1000XM4s at the top. But the AirPods Pro 2 prove you don't necessarily need an over-ear design anymore for truly immersive sound and excellent ANC from your headphones.\n\nRead our full Apple AirPods Pro 2 review\n\n(Image credit: Samsung)\n\n7. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro Easily the best Samsung Galaxy Buds yet Our expert review: Specifications Acoustic Design: Closed Weight: 5.5g Frequency Response: 20 - 20,000 Hz Drivers: Custom Coaxial 2-way Battery Life: 5 hours (earbuds) 18 hours (charging case) Today's Best Deals View at Samsung (opens in new tab) View at Best Buy (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Vastly improved hi-res sound quality + Solid ANC + Classy, comfortable design and finish Reasons to avoid - Battery life is only average\n\nSamsung has truly turned a corner with its latest Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, which forego futuristic looks in favor of great 24-bit sound, head-tracked spatial audio and a design that fits comfortably.\n\nApple, Sony, Bose, Sennheiser and in fact all of the best wireless earbuds manufacturers now need to take a good look at what Samsung has done with the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. They're good. No, really, they're good.\n\nThese smaller, more comfortable and less arrogant earbuds (remember the rose gold, kidney-bean shaped Galaxy Buds Live? These are nothing like those) are packed full of useful perks such as excellent ANC, voice detect, wearer detection and customizable on-ear controls – all of which work very well indeed – plus IPX7 water ingress protection.\n\nBut the headline-grabber, if you own a Samsung Galaxy device (and thus, access to the Samsung Wearable companion app and home-screen widget) is 360 audio with optional head-tracking, thus allowing you to use your phone as the focal point to direct more of that new end-to-end 24-bit high-res audio to whichever ear you prefer.\n\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro review\n\n(Image credit: 1More)\n\nAfter testing the 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Headphones for a few weeks, we're certain that they deliver fantastic sound and equally fantastic value for money. That's why we consider them to be the best headphones for those who prefer wired earbuds.\n\nFor $100 / £100 (about AU$168), it’s hard to find a better-sounding and more well-built pair of earphones than the 1MORE Triple Drivers – although if you want a little extra refinement and more luxurious materials, the same firm's 1MORE Quad Drivers are even more impressive, albeit at twice the price.\n\nBut at this price, and with such excellent build and design, it’s hard to fault the Triple Drivers. The inbuilt remote feels a little cheap, but that's more than made up for by the lush sound quality offered by these luxe-looking earbuds. For the price, you can't do better than 1MORE's Triple Driver in-ear headphones.\n\nRead our full 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Headphone review\n\n(Image credit: SoundMagic)\n\n9. SoundMAGIC E11BT The best wired earbuds on a budget Our expert review: Average Amazon review: (opens in new tab) ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Acoustic design: Closed Weight: 24.7g Frequency response: 20 - 20,000Hz Drivers: 10mm dynamic neodymium Battery life: 20 hours Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Fantastic price + Elegant design + Comfortable with ergonomic tips Reasons to avoid - Treble tones can sound harsh\n\nThe SoundMagic E11BTs are an extremely capable pair of wireless in-ear earphones, and given their low price, it really is difficult to fault them. The audio quality on offer here is fantastic with vocals sounding clear and smooth, while a hefty amount of bass helps elsewhere.\n\nTreble frequencies are sharp and crystal-clear too with a good level of attack. Although we also found that they might be a little harsh for anyone who wants to have a very warm soundstage.\n\nWe found these headphones comfortable to wear thanks to their ergonomically designed eartips, and we thought they looked elegant too. They're attached to a flat neckband that didn't irritate our skin while running or working out. They have an IPX4 rating, which means they should withstand sweaty sessions, so they're a solid option as a spare pair of workout earbuds.\n\nRead our full SoundMagic E11BT review\n\n(Image credit: Lypertek)\n\n10. Lypertek PurePlay Z3 2.0 The best budget true wireless earbuds Our expert review: Specifications Acoustic design: : Closed Frequency response: : 20Hz - 20kHz Drivers:: Graphene, 6mm dynamic Battery life: : 10 hours (earbuds) 70 hours (charging case) Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Excellent sound + Great price + Top-notch battery life Reasons to avoid - Ambient mode is poor\n\nWhen we first reviewed the original Lypertek PurePlay Z3 true wireless earbuds (then known as the Lypertek Tevi), we were blown away. The Lypertek PurePlay Z3 2.0 true wireless earbuds are their successors. They’re similar to the originals, include a few key improvements, and are available at the same affordable price point of $99 / £99.\n\nThat price gets you everything we loved about the original PurePlay Z3, including detailed balanced sound, a whopping 80 hours total battery life from its petite USB-C charging case, and a comfortably fitting bud with physical buttons. But the Z3 2.0 earbuds also add wireless charging, a powerful new LDX Audio mode, improved app functionality and a hear-through ambient mode.\n\nThe bad news is that we found the app connectivity to be patchy, and the ambient hear through mode isn't a patch on what you get from the likes of Sony’s noise cancelling WF-1000XM4. The hear-through mode is a shame, then, but these remain very impressive earbuds in terms of sound quality, stamina and affordability. They're more than a match for headphones two or three times the price.\n\nRead our full Lypertek PurePlay Z3 2.0 review\n\n(Image credit: Bowers & Wilkins)\n\n11. Bowers & Wilkins PX8 Wireless headphones that look stunning and sound even better Our expert review: Average Amazon review: (opens in new tab) ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Acoustic design: Closed Weight: 320g (without carry case) Frequency response: TBC Drivers: 2 x 40mm dynamic full range Battery life: 30 hours Today's Best Deals View at Crutchfield (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at World Wide Stereo (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Agile, detailed, class-leading sound + Supreme comfort during wear + Classy build and finish Reasons to avoid - Battery life has been beaten - Noise cancellation is average - Expensive\n\nSonically, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 are now the wireless over-ear headphones to beat. There, we said it. If that's all you need to hear, thank you for reading this particular buying guide. But if you want to know why we said \"sonically\" rather than \"across the board\", and why we gave them four-and-a-half stars rather than the full five, read on.\n\nThe simple fact is that the B&W PX8 are expensive. There are good, tangible, understandable reasons for this – a new carbon cone 40mm drive unit replaces the bio-cellulose driver in the more affordable Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2 and the die-cast aluminum arms, diamond-cut bright metal detailing and Nappa leather trim elevates the build to high-end territory – but for some, anything priced hotter than the AirPods Max is too rich for the blood given the current financial climate. We hear you.\n\nBut we have also heard the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 headphones and, cost of living crisis or no, they're exceptional.\n\nRead our full Bowers & Wilkins PX8 review\n\n(Image credit: Bose)\n\nIf the Sony WH-1000XM4s are the current king of noise-cancelling headphones, the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are next in line for the throne. We think the Sonys sound slightly better, but the Bose noise cancelling is superior – so if you're a frequent flyer these may well be the better option for you.\n\nBy applying noise cancellation to phone calls as well as music, Bose has made great strides in the field of noise-cancelling headphones. We found the sound quality to be undeniably good, with a vibrant, lively character and well-balanced soundstage.\n\nIf you’re trying to decide between buying the Sony WH-1000XM4s and these Bose headphones, we’d recommend going for the former because of that lower price and better battery life – they're our number one pick for those reasons. But you wouldn’t be making a mistake if you opted for the Bose cans instead (and we wouldn’t blame you if you did) – they sound great, look stunning, and the noise cancellation is out of this world.\n\nRead our full Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 review\n\n(Image credit: Bose)\n\nThis is Bose’s second attempt at a set of true wireless headphones, and the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are leaps and bounds better than the older SoundSport Free.\n\nThe design of these earbuds much improved and the noise cancellation is also exemplary. There are ten levels of ANC on offer here. At maximum, you’re practically cut off from the rest of the world, encased in a cocoon of sound that’s made entirely of your favourite tunes. You’ll only be able to hear some of the highest frequency sounds such as sirens, and even they’re muted to a large degree.\n\nThe Bose headphones aren't quite as bassy as Sony's rivals, but we enjoyed their superb clarity and consistently impressive sound quality. During our testing, we found these noise-cancelling earbuds incredibly comfortable and well balanced, too, and while we expected their bulky form factor to be an issue they're much more comfortable than they look.\n\nRead our full Bose QuietComfort Earbuds review\n\n(Image credit: Jabra)\n\n14. Jabra Elite 45h The best on-ear headphones Our expert review: Specifications Acoustic design: Closed Weight: 160g Frequency response: 20Hz-20,000Hz Drivers: 40mm Battery life: 50 hours Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Balanced sound + Impressive battery life Reasons to avoid - Leaky sound - Iffy call quality\n\nFor just $79 / £69/ AU$99, the Jabra Elite 45h gives you Bluetooth 5 connectivity, 40mm full-range dynamic drivers and a smattering of physical push-button controls in a wireless on-ear frame.\n\nWe like how the faux leather, memory foam and happily un-creaky plastic combined to deliver a fit we found extremely comfortable, although we weren't so keen on the way in which the ear pads reflect body heat right back: these phones get rather warm when you've been wearing them for a while.\n\nTech-wise, they hit all the key features. There’s voice control available from Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri. Jabra’s Sound+ control app even walks you through a brief hearing test to establish exactly how the EQs should be set to best suit your ears, giving you a surprisingly personal experience compared to others in this price range. By the standards of overtly affordable headphones, the Elite 45h are feature-packed.\n\nRead our full Jabra Elite 45h review\n\n(Image credit: Sony)\n\nTesting the Sony WH-CH510, we were amazed that wireless on-ear headphones could cost this little while delivering really decent sound, a USB-C port, and 35 hours of battery life.\n\nIf you’re looking for headphones at this price point, you’re likely already willing to make a few sacrifices. Thankfully, most of the compromises Sony has made with the WH-CH510 haven’t been too crucial – the lack of analog input mirrors, the loss of the 3.5mm port on most modern smartphones – and while the construction is a little plasticky they're lightweight, portable and comfortable.\n\nWhile they won’t have the superb clarity, balance, and sense of space that their WH-1000XM4 siblings deliver, the sound these on-ear headphones produce is much better than you'd expect from their size and price. You’ll find most genres perform well here, although tracks that already have low mids and bumped treble might get uncomfortably exaggerated.\n\nRead our full Sony WH-CH510 review\n\n(Image credit: Focal)\n\nIf money's no object, the Focal Stellia headphones could be the best headphones on the planet. The wide open soundstage on offer here and detailed, accurate sound treatment means they make any genre of music sound brilliant. If you listen to songs you think you know inside out, the precise separation of the frequencies here means that you will probably hear details you’ve never noticed before.\n\nIf you like to keep things minimal in the headphones department, you probably won’t like the showy, opulent design of the Focal Stellias, and they definitely do feel a little chunky for wearing on the commute into work. But if you like a bit of luxury, the full-grain leather cups, woven cables, brushed copper accents, and matching carrying case are likely to appeal.\n\nThat luxury feel is translated right down to the presentation of the user manuals in a neat little leather-style wallet. But then you'd expect to find this level of detail when you're parting with $3,000 / £2,799 (about AU$4,200). Ouch.\n\nRead our full Focal Stellia headphones review\n\nBest headphones: FAQ\n\nHow to choose the best headphones for you\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\n\nThere's a lot to consider when you're buying a new pair of headphones. But the most important is the design. This doesn't just dictate how they look, but the features on offer, how they feel when you wear them and how you'll use them day-to-day.\n\nIn-ear headphones, also called earbuds or earphones, are usually the cheapest and easiest way to pump audio into your ears. They rest in or just outside the ear canal, creating a tight seal to keep air out and sound in. These are the most discreet designs you'll find, making them excellent for portability and the prime choice for athletes.\n\nThe 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Headphones\n\nOver-ear headphones generally provide fantastic richness and depth of sound, which allows listeners to pick apart the instruments and sounds much easier. Additionally, over-ear, or circumaural headphones, go around the ear and offer a generous amount of padding.\n\nInstead of enveloping your ears, on-ear headphones create a light, breathable seal around your ear. The noise isolation is less effective than in-ear or over-ear options. But they're usually more portable than their over-ear brethren, appeal to travellers and make good fitness headphones.\n\nSome headphones don't go anywhere near your ears at all. Bone-conducting headphones send vibrations through your cheekbones and jaw up towards your inner ear, leaving your ears free. These headphones make great running headphones and swimming headphones.\n\nThe Focal Stellia over-ear headphones. (Image credit: Focal)\n\nWireless headphones fit into three different categories.\n\nWireless in-ear earphones connected via a neckband are ideal for runners who want the freedom of a wireless connection with the security of a wire keeping their earbuds firmly around their neck.\n\nWith wireless on-ear headphones and over-ear headphones, you simply lose the wire connecting them to your device – otherwise, they look pretty much the same as your regular pair of wired cans, and give you the noise-isolating prowess of over-ears without the need for cumbersome wires to connect to your device.\n\nTrue wireless earbuds have no cord whatsoever. For some, this means true freedom; for others, untethered true wireless means constant danger of losing their expensive audio kit down the drain – or terrible connections. The latter, at least, has changed now – thanks to advances in Bluetooth technology like aptX HD, the best true wireless earbuds have never sounded better.\n\nAre wired headphones better than wireless? Generally speaking, wired headphones do deliver better sound quality than wireless headphones. But there have been so many advances in audio tech in recent years, that with many of the best wireless headphones you're unlikely to notice a difference. That's why we often recommend audiophiles continue to opt for wired headphones. But for everyone else, it's mostly be down to personal preference. If wireless headphones suit you and are more convenient, they're a better choice for you. Get a good quality pair and you won't be missing out when it comes to sound quality.\n\nWhat are the best headphones I can buy right now? That depends on your preferences, style and budget. One of the most important considerations is design. Do you want a pair of in-ear headphones for running that are discrete and will stay snug all-day? Do you want a pair of true wireless headphones to give you ultimate flexibility? Or how about a big pair of over-ear headphones, the ultimate in noise cancellation and comfort? We've included a number of different headphone types below, like in-ear, on-ear, over-ear, wireless and true wireless. However, our top pick has to be the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones. They're fantastic all-rounders, offering a long battery life, noise cancellation, and excellent audio quality for the price.\n\nWhat is the number 1 headphone brand? There's no one perfect headphone brand out there. It all depends on your budget, audio needs, the features you want, and even the comfort or design involved with the headphones. That's why we've included numerous headphones covering different price ranges and feature sets. While major brands like Sony and Bose may stand out most, that doesn't mean you shouldn't rule out the others, with something for everyone out there.\n\nHow we test the best headphones\n\nWhen it comes to the best headphones, we focus on sound quality above everything else. We look at both wired and wireless cans and earbuds that would appeal to audiophiles, as well as those working in professional roles.\n\nHowever, we also appreciate that budget is important too, so we compare like for like, picking out budget headphones that perform admirably for the price.\n\nWe also look at other features such as ANC, battery life, fit, and of course the usability and extra perks offered by any companion apps. Of course, design and whether they look (and feel) good all adds to the model's desirability – and this is noted as we listen to music across a wide range of genres over several days.\n\nWe have tested all of the headphones in this guide extensively, spending plenty of time analyzing the sound, fit, design, specs, and value for money so that you will be able to choose a product you'll be over the moon with."
